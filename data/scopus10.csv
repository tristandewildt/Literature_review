So far, no EP&Ls have involved energy companies and none have involved wind energy or wind turbines. We perform an EP&L for three types of wind turbines sited and built in Northern Europe (Denmark and Norway) by a major manufacturer: a 3.2 MW onshore turbine with a mixed concrete steel foundation, a 3.0 MW offshore turbine with a steel foundation, and a 3.0 MW offshore turbine with a concrete foundation. For each of these three turbine types, we identify and monetize externalities related to carbon dioxide emissions, air pollution, and waste. We find that total environmental losses range from €1.1 million for the offshore turbine with concrete foundation to €740,000 for onshore turbines and about €500,000 for an offshore turbine with steel foundation—equivalent to almost one-fifth of construction cost in some instances. We conclude that carbon dioxide emissions dominate the amount of environmental damages and that turbines need to work for 2.5 to 5.5 years to payback their carbon debts. Even though turbines are installed in Europe, China and South Korea accounted for about 80% of damages across each type of turbine. Lastly, two components, foundations and towers, account for about 90% of all damages. We conclude with six implications for wind energy analysts, suppliers, manufacturers, and planners.

A comparison of value added and employment effects generated by the wind energy sector between the German federal states of Baden-Württemberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg reveals their specific competitive advantages in the value chain. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the wind energy sector can create value added and employment in various ways. Regional policies can help exploit the competitive advantages of the federal states but also aim to diversify local industries to participate and compete in multiple steps of the value chain. © 2013 A.

One such important indicator is the effect on health. This article presents a comparative risk analysis of mortality impacts arising from the generation of electricity by nuclear, coal, gas, onshore wind, and offshore wind UK power plants. The risk analysis was carried out using the J-value method, which provides a common, objective scale by which human harm can be valued. The analysis assessed human mortality impacts arising from the construction of future plants over the 60-year period from 2010 to 2070 for the entire fuel chain. Despite the considerable uncertainties in current estimates, the analysis provides evidence of the worth of the J-value methodology, particularly in relation to its ability to take explicit account of loss of life expectancy in evaluating delayed health effects. Risks are delineated according to two dimensions: whether the risk is occupational or public, and whether the risk is immediate or delayed. Impacts are also assessed for major accidents. The results indicate that nuclear generally has the lowest impacts, while gas, onshore wind and offshore wind have indicative impacts that are about an order of magnitude greater, although the estimates for both wind technologies carry considerable uncertainty. Coal power was found to present high impacts compared with the other technologies, mainly as a result of pollution emissions, even though the potential harm from some emissions has not been included because the effects are not fully understood. Total nuclear impacts were found to be sensitive to assumptions regarding the use of collective dose and the assumptions which are then used to calculate impacts. For the most pessimistic case, when world exposures are taken, total nuclear impacts increase by about an order of magnitude, which would render the risks from nuclear generation comparable with those from gas and wind generation. © Authors 2011."""

Thus mankind has to rely on the alternate/renewable energy sources like biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, etc. On the other hand, suitable waste management strategy is another important aspect of sustainable development. The growth of welfare levels in modern society during the past decades has brought about a huge increase in the production of all kinds of commodities, which indirectly generate waste. Plastics have been one of the materials with the fastest growth because of their wide range of applications due to versatility and relatively low cost. Since the duration of life of plastic products is relatively small, there is a vast plastics waste stream that reaches each year to the final recipients creating a serious environmental problem. Again, because disposal of post consumer plastics is increasingly being constrained by legislation and escalating costs, there is considerable demand for alternatives to disposal or land filling. Advanced research in the field of green chemistry could yield biodegradable/green polymers but is too limited at this point of time to substitute the non-biodegradable plastics in different applications. Once standards are developed for degradable plastics they can be used to evaluate the specific formulations of materials which will find best application in this state as regards their performance and use characteristics. Among the alternatives available are source reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of the inherent energy value through waste-to-energy incineration and processed fuel applications. Production of liquid fuel would be a better alternative as the calorific value of the plastics is comparable to that of fuels, around 40 MJ/kg. Each of these options potentially reduces waste and conserves natural resources. Plastics recycling, continues to progress with a wide range of old and new technologies. Many research projects have been undertaken on chemical recycling of waste plastics to fuel and monomer. This is also reflected by a number of pilot, demonstration, and commercial plants processing various types of plastic wastes in Germany, Japan, USA, India, and elsewhere.

The site assessment is designed to provide residential and business customers with renewable resource and economic information on the options to install a renewable energy system (solar electric, solar water heat or wind) on their property. To determine the impact of the site assessments and the value that the assessments provide to customers, a survey was conducted in the first quarter of 2006 of past participants. Forty nine percent of customers answered questions about whether they had installed a system, the value of the site assessment in their decision and if they had not installed a system, the likelihood of an installation in the future and the barriers to installing a solar electric, solar water heating or wind energy system. Eighty-five percent of respondents thought the site assessment was either somewhat or very useful based on four different types of analysis offered. The Wisconsin site assessment process is also a key way to develop the market for renewable energy businesses. The number of Certified Site Assessors working in Wisconsin has grown from none in December of 2001 to 52 as of December 31, 2006. Twenty-two of these have started new businesses."""

In most cases, PV and WECS power outputs are subtracted from the utility load with the expectation that conventional generation would meet the residual load. This approach is valid for small penetration levels and/or for PV and WECS facilities connected near load centers. However, several constraints such as thermal generation characteristics, fuel supply and delivery, spinning reserve requirements, and hydro availability are not adequately represented in this process. To determine the optimal value of large-scale PV and WECS applications, a new methodology that would take into account the forthmentioned constraints as well as a more global penetration is being developed. The proposed methodology also handles constrained combustion turbines and hydro power plant generation. While PV systems are considered as a prototype to test the methodology, WECS and other renewable energy sources can be handled similarly. Performance analysis shows that hydro availability, generation mix and characteristics, spinning reserve requirements, maintenance schedule, PV power output dynamics, and load variations influence the economic and operational value of large-scale PV generation. Results indicate that while high hydro availability increases PV penetration levels, high ramping rates can also significantly increase penetration levels. © 1992 IEEE"""

A statistical approach is developed for assessing the operational impacts, including thermal plant cycling and operating reserve requirements. It is shown from this analysis that operating penalties are negligible when the capacities involved are small relative to the overall system, as long as reserve is optimally scheduled. Simplified equations are also presented for estimating operating penalties from limited data. The paper then discusses the impact of variable sources at higher system penetrations, and uses modelling studies to examine the possible economic value of wind energy up to very high capacities. The possible technical characteristics of future power systems are discussed in this light. Finally, the paper examines the contribution of variable sources to system reliability and the nature of capital savings arising from this. The capacity contribution in many circumstances is equivalent to conventional sources, but in general the importance of capacity issues is much less than generally believed. The overall conclusion is that for a given energy output, variable sources are often as valuable as equivalent conventional sources when the capacity is small, and their contribution can be very large before the penalties of variability become significant."""

Altamont Pass appears to be reaching its maximum potential wind capacity, at least with the present types of turbines and land use restrictions. Pacheco Pass has had some development and there is room for expansion in this good wind site. New wind power plants are being built in the Solano County wind resource area. Costs of wind energy are estimated based on the wind power plant installed costs and actual performance and operation and maintenance costs, which indicate that wind power is becoming competitive with new fossil fuel-fired power plants. Wind energy costs were compared to those of solar thermal and photovoltaic technologies and found to be most attractive of these alternative energy sources. Projections of the future costs of these three renewable resources are made. The value of wind energy is computed based on how well it fits PG&E hourly loads. The peak wind generally comes later in the day than peak utility loads. A similar analysis of solar energy shows a better fit of utility loads, but peak solar input comes before peak utility loads. This suggests that a combination of wind and solar energy would be a good fit to utility needs."""

Two models, from which very different results have been reported, are compared on a similar basis, and it is shown that they then give good agreement. The sensitivity of the results to particular assumptions is then examined. It is shown that changing just a few basic parameters, particularly those relating to system operating reserve allocation, thermal part load limits, and wind-power diversity and predictability, can have a dramatic effect upon the computed value of the wind energy. Difference in assumptions between the studies can adequately explain the different results obtained. Likely values for the most significant inputs are then discussed, and it is concluded that in the long term the operating penalties on large power systems are likely to be less severe than many modelling studies have suggested. The results emphasize the need for care in formulating the inputs for such studies."""
