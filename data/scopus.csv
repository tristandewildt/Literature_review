Then the optimal distribution is chosen through the Chi-square error (CSE), the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test error (KSE), and the root mean square error (RMSE) criteria. However, it is found that the variation range of some criteria is quite large, thus these criteria are analyzed and evaluated both from the anomalous values and by the K-means clustering method. Anomaly observation results have shown that the CSE is the first one should be considered to be eliminated from the consequent optimal distribution function selection.

This topic has indeed brought about an increasing number of studies in the last years, both for wind energy production assessment and also in risk and reliability analysis.

In fact, properly tuned lifting lines are key for the accurate simulation of wind energy systems, for example in the areas of performance, aeroelasticity and wake aerodynamics. The problem is formulated as the constrained optimization of a maximum likelihood cost function, driven by measurements of the rotor loads at the hub and possibly along the blades. Additive functions that correct the lift and drag characteristics of the blade airfoils are identified"	 such functions depend on the angle of attack and on the spanwise location along the blade, dependence that is approximated using suitable shape functions and their associated nodal parameters. The estimation problem expressed in terms of the physical nodal parameters is shown to be difficult and typically ill-posed, because of low observability and collinearity of the unknowns. To overcome this difficulty, a novel method is proposed that uses a singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix. By this decomposition, the problem is recast in terms of a new set of variables that are statistically independent	" in turn, this is used for readily selecting only those parameters that are associated with a sufficiently high level of confidence. The mapping between the new statistically independent and the original physical parameters is expressed by eigenshape functions, whose inspection clarifies which parameters are observable in which ranges of the angle of attack and blade span domain. The paper is complemented by examples that illustrate the main features of the proposed method. At first, a scaled rotor model is tested in a wind tunnel, and hub measurements are used for the calibration of its lifting line model, whose nominal characteristics appear to be largely in error. Much improvement in the fidelity of the lifting line is observed after calibration by the procedure described here.

Locations are not always places that please naturalists or local people, since the presence of turbines may compromise valuable landscape-related or cultural features, even to the extent that the environment is harmed. There thus remains a need for cohesive research methodology by which to determine or identify areas predisposed for the location of wind farms subsequent to the specifi cities of given places having been taken fully into account. If such a methodology is developed, then it can be hoped that the negative impact of wind power plants will be limited, and local communities will be able to fi nd their own benefi ts arising out of their establishment.

These would then be available as a basis for proposing specifi c sites for windpower development within a given gmina (local authority area) located in the Polish Carpathians and serving as an example. The selected area is characterized by numerous environmental values in need of protection, but nevertheless partly given over for economic use (Fig. 1). There are many similar areas in the Polish Carpathians, so it is important that the limitations and possibilities that exist should be exemplifi ed for a far wider area. Tools of a geostatistical and geoinformatic nature were used in the study, analyses being performed on spatial data obtained in the form of maps, digital databases and a digital elevation model. Non-cartographic sources of information about the area were also used. An important stage to the work carried out entailed the adoption of values for the width of buffer zones around selected objects, not least because some of these value arise out of legislation in force, while others have been proposed by the authors. The degree of land suitability for the construction of wind turbines was determined using multi-criteria analysis (MCA), as method involving the use of criteria in the form of functions. Criteria were in turn analysed using the method of weighted linear combination (WLC), which offers a simple combination of layers based initially on the multiplication of parameters and the estimated weight of a given criterion, and then adding together the results of multiplications carried out for all criteria. Since the application of this method entails substantial subjectivity at the time weightings are assigned, additional use was made of a hierarchical method of analysis of a problem (AHP = the analytic hierarchy process, as developed by T. Saaty (Bryndza, 2006). Finally, layers corresponding to location factors were standardized and, as a result of multiplying the standardized layers by estimated weights followed by the summation of the results, a map of land suitability for investment was generated in two variants: for the conditions associated with the presence of power lines (Fig. 6A), and allowing for the distance from the main points of power supply (Fig. 6B). These maps reveal a dichotomy within the gmina of Rymanów, which is seen to have a southern zone of lesser suitability of land, and a northern one manifesting higher values for the suitability parameter. However, this does not mean that no energy developments at all can be implemented in the southern zone. Rather, it will be necessary for a number of legal, social, environmental and technical barriers to be overcome, this usually in practice denoting higher cost effectiveness. Equally, areas in the central part of the gmina should clearly be excluded from such activity.

In the second method, 3-phase inductance is connected in series with the stator terminals. This method reduced these transients by 50% and improved the system power factor.

Based on a survey of residents of coastal Michigan, this article explores the role of general values and beliefs in shaping attitudes towards the potential development of commercial wind energy projects in or near respondents' communities. Structural equation modeling reveals that support of commercial wind energy depends largely on a belief that wind farms will provide economic benefits to the community.

Lack of infinite bus, tightly coupled generation and consumption, and existence of nondispatchable intermittent renewable power sources reinforce the need for a new VVC scheme. This paper presents a new model predictive control (MPC)-based dynamic voltage and var control (VVC) scheme, which includes the dynamics of the microgrid in the VVC formulation. The MPC-based controller uses a simplified voltage prediction model to predict the voltage behavior of the system for a time horizon ahead. The advantage of this method is that it can avoid unstable voltage conditions in microgrids by prediction of the instability ahead of time. This method can also avoid voltage drops or swells in any of the phases of the system since the model can predict the voltage of each phase separately. Also, the presented method can be implemented online so it can efficiently use the time-variant reactive capabilities of the distributed generators to compensate for reactive power needs of the system.

Various sizes and geometries of experimental riblets were provided by 3M Company and tested at angles of attack ranging from 0° ? ? ? 10° (0.25 ? C L ? 1.14) and at a Reynolds number of Re = 2.2 × 10 6. Mean drag was measured via wake survey (momentum deficit) and with a sensitive force balance. Lift was measured directly from the force balance. Tests included the cases of complete and partial riblet coverage on the wing. Results indicated that riblets could provide an overall reduction of skin friction drag, and that the amount of the decrease varied with riblet height and geometry. Partial riblet coverage appears in some cases more efficient than its complete coverage counterpart. The percentage of drag the riblets reduced varied greatly and in some cases the riblets were even detrimental to the airfoil. The most efficient riblet for a completely covered airfoil was found to be the V-groove shape of 100 ?m height. It produced a reduction of roughly 6% in the operational range expected in a turbine airfoil. On the other hand, the most efficient riblet size for partial coverage was also a V-groove shape and seemed to shift slightly to a smaller peak height of 80 ?m. This configuration produced a reduction of roughly 4% in the range of angle of attack that is typical for operation in the field. The average non-dimensional square root of the groove cross-section, l +, defined in terms of the drag coefficient at design angle of attack for the optimum riblet configuration in the fully coverage case was found to be l +?10, which is very close to the optimum value found for planar surfaces. Based on our results we propose a formulation for the optimum riblet size in airfoil considering the mean drag coefficient and chord length Reynolds number.

Distributed wind energy applications are an attractive option in some Mid- Atlantic States and may be the key to unlocking the potential of a large and economically viable resource. Although the economic value of distributed wind plants is not significantly less than elsewhere, especially in coastal areas, deployment has been slow. Two issues that contribute to this apathetic growth are discussed in this paper. First, there is a general lack of wind resource measurement data especially at potentially good wind sites and therefore existing sources and models may be under predicting the potential. Early regional wind maps showed marginal wind energy potential at 50 meter height. Today it is known that better resources exist at hub height and above on today's commercial turbines. Second, the Federal wind program focused most attention on defined resources the Midwest. Another reason for slow growth is that weak policies act as a deterrent to the entire multistate region. In Maryland and Virginia, existing renewable portfolio programs can be satisfied with renewable energy credits (""""RECs"""") generated by projects that existed long before the portfolio standards or can be purchased elsewhere in the country (except solar RECs must originate Maryland). Crediting pre-existing biomass projects with RECs diminishes the efficacy of portfolio programs. North Carolina limits REC to new sources but has conservative goals and other limitations due to view-shed issues. Maryland recently introduced net metering rules that are attractive to wind and solar by allowing some customers to sell electricity back up to 200% of the normal consumption. The price is retail or about 8-10 cents/kWh less transport and administration fees. This is allowed for projects smaller than two megawatts. As the flaws in the renewable portfolio programs are fixed and the significant economic value of the existing incentives are recognized, distributed wind is likely to be the precursor to large scale wind deployment in the mid-Atlantic region.

One such important indicator is the effect on health. This article presents a comparative risk analysis of mortality impacts arising from the generation of electricity by nuclear, coal, gas, onshore wind, and offshore wind UK power plants. The risk analysis was carried out using the J-value method, which provides a common, objective scale by which human harm can be valued. The analysis assessed human mortality impacts arising from the construction of future plants over the 60-year period from 2010 to 2070 for the entire fuel chain. Despite the considerable uncertainties in current estimates, the analysis provides evidence of the worth of the J-value methodology, particularly in relation to its ability to take explicit account of loss of life expectancy in evaluating delayed health effects. Risks are delineated according to two dimensions: whether the risk is occupational or public, and whether the risk is immediate or delayed. Impacts are also assessed for major accidents. The results indicate that nuclear generally has the lowest impacts, while gas, onshore wind and offshore wind have indicative impacts that are about an order of magnitude greater, although the estimates for both wind technologies carry considerable uncertainty. Coal power was found to present high impacts compared with the other technologies, mainly as a result of pollution emissions, even though the potential harm from some emissions has not been included because the effects are not fully understood. Total nuclear impacts were found to be sensitive to assumptions regarding the use of collective dose and the assumptions which are then used to calculate impacts. For the most pessimistic case, when world exposures are taken, total nuclear impacts increase by about an order of magnitude, which would render the risks from nuclear generation comparable with those from gas and wind generation. © Authors 2011."""

In the Nordic electricity markets wind power producers at the markets sell their production based on day-ahead forecasts and pay imbalance fees for prediction errors. Most of the wind power production goes through Balance Responsible Players that have time to adjust the planned production levels or enter trades up to the hour of delivery. In this paper, the imbalance fees for dispersed wind power in Finland for year 2004 data are calculated with four options. The base case leaves all dayahead forecast errors to balance settlement. Imbalance cost will then be 0.62 €/MWh for dispersed wind power in Finland. The crossover benefit of combining the imbalances of wind with imbalances of load and other production proves to be large, especially if the imbalances can be combined with those of load. Different options for active trade 3 hours before delivery or internal balancing show that it is only cost effective if trading close to spot market prices (at low wind penetration). A rough estimate shows that 400 MW of hydro power could provide internal balancing to cover 83...63% of the forecast errors of wind power, when wind power is 200...400 MW.

Main goal is to incorporate the prioritization criteria for the assessment of various energy policies for power alternatives, and evaluating these policies against these criteria. The three types of EPPs reviewed in this study are: electricity production from wind farms in the future, existing coal-based thermal power plants and planned nuclear power plants. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to assess the main and sub-factors of EPPs. Main factors such as economic, technical, social and environmental are assigned in first level of the AHP. The importance weights of factors are produced and priority values with realistic numbers are obtained using Fuzzy-AHP Chang's Model. Priority value for wind energy was determined as two times higher than the others when making the ultimate decision. On aggregate, importance weights of environmental (0.68) and social (0.69) factors make wind power leader. Sub-factors such as public acceptance, waste-emission and environmental impacts cause both nuclear and thermal power to have the lowest priority numbers. Additionally, the CO2 emissions trade was determined to be a very important criterion associated with both economic and environmental factors according to Kyoto Protocol. This study concludes that Turkey's existing thermal power stations should gradually be substituted by renewable energy options according to a schedule of Turkish energy policies in future. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."""

Thus mankind has to rely on the alternate/renewable energy sources like biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, etc. On the other hand, suitable waste management strategy is another important aspect of sustainable development. The growth of welfare levels in modern society during the past decades has brought about a huge increase in the production of all kinds of commodities, which indirectly generate waste. Plastics have been one of the materials with the fastest growth because of their wide range of applications due to versatility and relatively low cost. Since the duration of life of plastic products is relatively small, there is a vast plastics waste stream that reaches each year to the final recipients creating a serious environmental problem. Again, because disposal of post consumer plastics is increasingly being constrained by legislation and escalating costs, there is considerable demand for alternatives to disposal or land filling. Advanced research in the field of green chemistry could yield biodegradable/green polymers but is too limited at this point of time to substitute the non-biodegradable plastics in different applications. Once standards are developed for degradable plastics they can be used to evaluate the specific formulations of materials which will find best application in this state as regards their performance and use characteristics. Among the alternatives available are source reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of the inherent energy value through waste-to-energy incineration and processed fuel applications. Production of liquid fuel would be a better alternative as the calorific value of the plastics is comparable to that of fuels, around 40 MJ/kg. Each of these options potentially reduces waste and conserves natural resources. Plastics recycling, continues to progress with a wide range of old and new technologies. Many research projects have been undertaken on chemical recycling of waste plastics to fuel and monomer. This is also reflected by a number of pilot, demonstration, and commercial plants processing various types of plastic wastes in Germany, Japan, USA, India, and elsewhere.

UAV dynamics are described in terms of a dynamic point-mass model, and vehicle motion is constrained via boundary controls to a three-dimensional region around a specified target point. Models of closed-loop trajectory tracking are developed using the method of dynamic inversion for both airspeed vector tracking and boundary trajectory tracking. A nominal reference trajectory is assumed in which the UAV flies a fixed radius, constant altitude orbit with an airspeed that would maximize the endurance in zero wind. Simulations conducted for varying wind patterns compare the average power consumption of the proposed strategy with that of the reference trajectory. Obtained results indicate a potential saving in power consumption and in endurance of the UAV by simply using the appropriate wind component instantaneously during the flight regime.

Hi h penetration of wind power has impacts that have to be manage through proper plant interconnection, integration, transmission planning, and system and market operations. This report is a summary of case studies addressing concerns about the impact of wind power.s variability and uncertainty on power system reliability and costs. The case studies summarized in this report are not easy to compare due to different methodology and data used, as well as different assumptions on the interconnection capacity available. Integration costs of wind power need to be compared to something, like the production costs or market value of wind power, or integration cost of other production forms. There is also benefit when adding wind power to power systems: it reduces the total operating costs and emissions as wind fossil fuels. Severalissues that impact on the amount of wind power that can be integrated have been identified. Large balancing areas and aggregation benefits of large areas help in reducing the variability and forecast errors of wind power as well as help in pooling more cost effective balancing resources. System operation and working electricity markets at less than day-ahead time scales help reduce forecast errors of wind power. Transmission is the key to aggregation benefits, electricity markets and larger balancing areas. From the investigated studies it follows that at wind penetrations of up to 20 % of gross demand (energy), system operating cost increases arising from wind variability and uncertainty amounted to about 1.4 ./MWh.

However, the intermittency of wind and solar power is a major obstacle to their broader use. The additional risks of unexpected interruptions and mismatch with demand have hindered the expansion of these two primary renewable resources. The goal of this research is to analyze an integrated energy system that includes a novel configuration of wind and solar coupled with two storage methods to make both wind and solar sources dispatchable during peak demand, thereby enabling their broader use. The proposed system utilizes compressed air energy storage (CAES) that is driven from wind energy and thermal storage supplied by concentrated solar thermal power in order to achieve this desired dispatchability. While current CAES facilities use off peak electricity to power their compressors, this system uses power from wind turbines to compress air to high pressure for storage. Also, rather than using natural gas for heating of the compressed air before its expansion through a turbine, which it typical for conventional systems, the system described in this paper replaces the use of natural gas with solar thermal energy and thermal storage. Through a thermodynamic and a levelised lifetime cost analysis we have been able to develop estimates of the power system performance and the cost of energy for this integrated wind-solar-storage system. What we found is that the combination of these components resulted in an efficiency of over 50% for the main power components. We also estimated that the overall system is more expensive per unit of electricity generated than two of the current technologies employed today, namely coal and nuclear, but cheaper than natural gas peaking units. However, this economic analysis, though accurate with regard to the technologies chosen, will not be complete until cost values can be placed on some of the externalities associated with power generation such as fuel cost volatility, national security, and emissions.

This paper addresses problems faced in our study. As a rule definitions of the boundaries of bioenergy systems and assumptions made in investigations differ from one analyst to another. Therefore understanding the background of a research is at least as important as the results. Extraction of bioenergy needs also energy that is usually assumed to be fossil energy. To extract fossil energy requires considerably less efforts than that of bioenergy, which makes bioenergy chains look more energy efficient than they really are. Additionally, the indirect energy input is often inadequately analyzed and underestimated. The output energy of a biomass production chain is usually expressed as a heating value of the dry matter. However, heat is at a low level in the energy hierarchy. Refining biomass to a higher level (such as electricity or traffic fuel) causes energy losses and decreases the output. Thus energy quality should be properly included in the analysis. Biomass production needs favorable growing conditions, wind energy needs wind, and solar energy needs sunshine. Energy and a massive logistic system are needed for biomass transportation to the refinery. Storms, frost, plant deceases or insects can destroy the bioenergy crop.

This paper explores the question, """"Is there additional value to be gained from wind power curtailment for reasons other than grid stability?"""" Data from the hydroelectric system in British Columbia, Canada are used to perform numerous year-long simulation and optimization runs. These are performed to determine the hydro generation system's response under constrained circumstances with and without wind curtailment capability. The economic impact of curtailment to both the hydroelectric utility and the wind power producers are identified and discussed. These assumptions and impacts include changes to market prices of energy, operating reserve requirements, annual electrical energy production, hypothetical value of wind energy, and generating capacity and energy exchanges on the market. From the initial results and annual analyses of these simulation and optimization modeling runs, several observations can be made. 1) The hydroelectric utility could increase the value of wind energy very slightly (0.1% to 0.02% for wind capacity penetration levels 3% to 12%) during a dry water year if allowed the option of curtailing wind power, but still requiring it to pay the wind power producer for all available wind power. 2) Under the same requirements, but during a wet water year, the value of wind energy could increase a greater amount: 0.2% to 1.0% for wind capacity penetration levels 3% to 12%. 3) For either the dry or wet water year, total annual wind energy curtailment is less than 2.5%.

Because the fuel is free it provides the ultimate in energy independence. Wind energy has emerged as a leading prospect, in part, because it is considered by many to be environmentally sustainable. However, a key question that remains is whether wind energy is financially sustainable without the extensive government support that has helped to create and nurture this growth industry. Using reliable, proprietary data from field research, our analysis employs a capital budgeting framework to evaluate the financial economics of investments in wind energy.

The wind wheel can get maximum wind energy when its blade tip speed ratio is an optimum value. When wind speed is less than the rated speed, the rotation speed of the wind turbine generator system should be controlled in order to get the optimum blade tip ratio. When wind speed is larger than the rated speed, the output power must be also controlled by changing the pitch angle of the blade according to the wind speed or the wind turbine will be damaged because of the over load. To get the maximum output power under lower wind speed and to maintain the stable rated output power under higher wind speed, the proper method must be used. In classical control, the controller design needs the accurate mathematical model of the wind turbine generator system, but this model is very difficult to get. To solve this problem, we use fuzzy controller to trace the maximum power when wind speed is lower than the rated speed and use neural network to get the proper pitch angle and so to limit the output power when the wind speed is greater than the rated speed.

Although the wind stress is uniform, the near-inertial motion field quickly becomes spatially heterogeneous, involving horizontal scales much smaller than the eddy scales. Analysis confirms that refraction by the eddy relative vorticity is the main mechanism responsible for the horizontal distortion of the near-inertial motions, which subsequently triggers their vertical propagation. An important result is the appearance of two maxima of near-inertial vertical velocity (both with rms values reaching 40 m day-1): one at a depth of 100 m and another unexpected one much below the main thermocline around 1700 m. The shallow maximum, captured by the highest vertical normal modes, involves near-inertial motions with a spatial heterogeneity close to the eddy vorticity gradient field. These characteristics match analytical results obtained with Young and Ben Jelloul's approach. The deep maximum, captured by the lowest vertical normal modes, involves superinertial motions with a frequency of twice the inertial frequency and much smaller horizontal scales. Because of these characteristics, not anticipated by previous analytical studies, these superinertial motions may represent an energy source for small-scale mixing through a mechanism not taken into account in the present study: the parametric subharmonic instability (PSI).

The study indicates the costs of generated energy by wind turbines with different characteristics as a function of the installed capacity. It is concluded that, the larger the installed capacity, the smaller the generating cost per kWh. The generating cost was calculated as low as 2.68 UScent/kWh for the IPP scenario. The profitability analysis also shows that, larger installed capacity with larger rated power wind turbines present higher IRR of the investment. The sensitivity analysis backs up the findings. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."""

While some reasons behind India's emergence are the abundance of natural resources and a maturing of the more established industries, the scale of projects that have been undertaken are also a major contributor to the growth. The Indian economy is moving towards a value added tax (VAT) based system, reducing the significance of tax based investment as an incentive driver. India now needs to create a mechanism that will enable grid access, supported by long term bankable power purchase agreements for the power generated by new wind farms."""

An energy storage system associated to the studied wind farm allows to increase the installed capacity while maintaining the same upper limit for the wind farm production power. This operation may enhance the wind farm availability and present an added value to the project by increasing its energy sales.

In wind engineering, the possible extreme wind velocities constitute the basic targets in risk evaluations. In practice, lower extremes are significant for low energy generation possibilities and for power-cut risks, depending on the turbine type. However, upper extremes endanger the stability of the wind turbines. Additionally, the maxima of wind velocity variations have fundamental importance in engineering structural designs. Besides, from the meteorological point of view, maximum wind velocities directly relate to storms and thunderstorms. In this paper, wind velocity exceedence maps over 10, 12, 15 and 20 m/s are produced for Turkey, and the necessary interpretations are given.

These trends are examined and future costs assessed. Although the United Kingdom has regions of high wind speed, these are often in difficult terrain and construction costs are often higher than elsewhere in Europe. Nevertheless, wind energy costs are converging with those of the conventional thermal sources. At present bank loan periods for wind projects are shorter than for thermal plant, which means that energy prices are higher. Ways of overcoming this problem are explored. It is important, also, to examine the value of wind energy. It is argued that wind energy has a higher value than energy from centralized plant, since it is fed into the low-voltage distribution network. © 1995, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

In most cases, PV and WECS power outputs are subtracted from the utility load with the expectation that conventional generation would meet the residual load. This approach is valid for small penetration levels and/or for PV and WECS facilities connected near load centers. However, several constraints such as thermal generation characteristics, fuel supply and delivery, spinning reserve requirements, and hydro availability are not adequately represented in this process. To determine the optimal value of large-scale PV and WECS applications, a new methodology that would take into account the forthmentioned constraints as well as a more global penetration is being developed. The proposed methodology also handles constrained combustion turbines and hydro power plant generation. While PV systems are considered as a prototype to test the methodology, WECS and other renewable energy sources can be handled similarly. Performance analysis shows that hydro availability, generation mix and characteristics, spinning reserve requirements, maintenance schedule, PV power output dynamics, and load variations influence the economic and operational value of large-scale PV generation. Results indicate that while high hydro availability increases PV penetration levels, high ramping rates can also significantly increase penetration levels. © 1992 IEEE"""

A statistical approach is developed for assessing the operational impacts, including thermal plant cycling and operating reserve requirements. It is shown from this analysis that operating penalties are negligible when the capacities involved are small relative to the overall system, as long as reserve is optimally scheduled. Simplified equations are also presented for estimating operating penalties from limited data. The paper then discusses the impact of variable sources at higher system penetrations, and uses modelling studies to examine the possible economic value of wind energy up to very high capacities. The possible technical characteristics of future power systems are discussed in this light. Finally, the paper examines the contribution of variable sources to system reliability and the nature of capital savings arising from this. The capacity contribution in many circumstances is equivalent to conventional sources, but in general the importance of capacity issues is much less than generally believed. The overall conclusion is that for a given energy output, variable sources are often as valuable as equivalent conventional sources when the capacity is small, and their contribution can be very large before the penalties of variability become significant."""

Two models, from which very different results have been reported, are compared on a similar basis, and it is shown that they then give good agreement.

It is shown that changing just a few basic parameters, particularly those relating to system operating reserve allocation, thermal part load limits, and wind-power diversity and predictability, can have a dramatic effect upon the computed value of the wind energy. Difference in assumptions between the studies can adequately explain the different results obtained. Likely values for the most significant inputs are then discussed, and it is concluded that in the long term the operating penalties on large power systems are likely to be less severe than many modelling studies have suggested.
