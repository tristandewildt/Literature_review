An Inverse Burr distribution is proposed as an useful alternative for the probabilistic modeling of extreme values of wind speed.

The analytical results show that the wind speed and wind direction at RSB site are greatly influenced by the subtropical monsoon climate and typhoon climate. And the traditional known rules concerning turbulence intensity are not proper for strong winds, while the rules can be validated by long-Term monitored data. Meanwhile, the recommended values of turbulence integral scale by current specification are suitable for long-Term monitored wind, but the adaptability to strong wind is still defective. In addition, the measured along-wind spectra match generally well with the commonly used PSDs of turbulence. However, more researches are still needed to refine current PSDs of turbulence to perfectly satisfy with the measured spectrum. The conclusions can provide references for the wind-resistant analysis of RSB and structures in similar areas. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company."""

More studies are required in both their modeling and operating aspects. In this regard, this paper attempts to develop medium-term management of an energy hub in restructured power systems. A model is presented to manage an energy hub which has electrical energy and natural gas as inputs and electrical and heat energy as outputs. Electricity is procured in various ways, either purchasing it from a pool-based market and bilateral contracts, or producing it from a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit, a diesel generator unit and Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). Pool prices and wind turbine production are subject to uncertainty, which makes energy management a complex puzzle. Heat demand is also procured by a furnace and a CHP unit. Energy hub managers should make decisions whether to purchase electricity from the electricity market and gas from the gas network or to produce electricity using a set of generators to meet the electrical and heat demands in the presence of uncertainties. The energy management objective is to minimize the total cost subject to several technical constraints using stochastic programming. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure, is used to reduce the unfavorable risk of costs. In doing so, the proposed model is illustrated using a sample test case with actual prices, load and wind speed data. The results show that the minimum cost is obtained by the best decisions involving the electricity market and purchasing natural gas for gas facilities. Considering risk also increases the total expected cost and decreases the CVaR. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."""

In this framework, the fixed base natural frequency of the wind turbine is first calculated and is then multiplied by two non-dimensional factors to account for the foundation flexibility (i.e. the effect of soil-structure interaction). The theoretical background behind the model is the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories where the foundation is idealised by three coupled springs (lateral, rocking and cross-coupling). 10 wind turbines founded in different ground conditions from 10 different wind farms in Europe (e.g. Walney, Gunfleet sand, Burbo Bank, Belwind, Barrow, Kentish flat, Blyth, Lely, Thanet Sand, Irene Vorrink) have been analysed and the results compared with the measured natural frequencies.

This modeling requires proper knowledge of the physical events during stall regime, such knowledge can be better attained from experimental data.

Since these limits are designed to protect the amenity of the people residing indoors, the outdoor to indoor noise reduction is an important consideration.

However, traffic noise is dominated by mid-frequency energy, whereas wind farm noise is dominated by low-frequency energy for which expected noise reductions are much less. This paper investigates typical noise reductions for residences near wind farms that are located in rural areas in Australia. It is found that during the night, when the wind farm is operating and the local wind speed is low, the A-weighted outdoor to indoor noise reductions with closed windows are less than 20 dB, which is at least 10 dB lower than the value generally assumed for traffic noise in urban areas. Furthermore, the C-weighted, G-weighted and low-frequency A-weighted (10 Hz - 160 Hz) noise reductions are lower still, indicating that A-weighted noise reduction values are not representative for noise dominated by low-frequencies. Outdoor to indoor noise reduction generally decreases with frequency, however, there are some variations to this trend which are related to housing construction. Structural resonances, room modes and coupling between the air volume inside the residence and the stiffness of the walls, roof and ceiling can contribute to reducing the noise reduction, sometimes to negative values.

Because, these units include MT, ES and Fc, are more controllable and observable, so they can help to increase the freedom degree of Micro-Grid' control. For achieving this aim, the state feedback method is used. Also for removing of disturbance due to mentioned dynamic units of micro-grid, more than state variables of Micro-Grid, it is necessary that the new state variable as name as integral of power deviation is added to system too. In other word, the applied approach for control Frequency improving is state feedback with integral control. By controlling all of controllable units (MT, FC, ES) and feeding back the integral of the tracking error, it can be guaranteed that at any moment, output (power deviation) converges to set point (zero). In this paper, integral state feedback gains is determined using PSO algorithm, and minimizing the maximum of eigenvalues is chose as objective function of optimization problem. The proposed control method is applied to damp the frequency fluctuations and enhance the power imbalance.

The contribution of this work is the implementation of PI fuzzy model reference learning controller (FMRLC) to SVC control loop. The control algorithm compensates for nonlinearity possessed by MG where fuzzy membership functions and implication imbedded in both controller and inverse model that achieve better presentation of both uncertainty and nonlinearity of the power system dynamics. Hence, MG keeps desired performance as required irrespective of the operating condition. In addition, learning capabilities of the proposed control algorithm compensates for grid parameter variation even with inadequate information about mathematical presentation of load dynamics. The reference model was designed to reject bus voltage disturbance, created by load and wind variation, with achievable desired performance. Accordingly, SVC with fuzzy controller was able to reject bus voltage disturbance by matching closely the reference model performance. Simulations were carried out to study the steady-state and transient performance of MG in islanded mode. The MG is composed of a PV bus supplied by wind turbine and induction generator, a PQ bus connected to nonlinear dynamic load and linear load, a single distribution line connecting the two buses, and SVC. The proposed control algorithm robustness was tested by providing load disturbance in different operating conditions and observing the system dynamic performance. The performance of the proposed controller is compared to a conventional PID controller using overshoot, transient oscillation, Integral-of-Time Multiplied Absolute Error (ITMAE), and integral square error (ISE) as performance parameters. Both ITMAE and ISE values for the proposed controller were much less than conventional PID controller.

The sensitivity analysis results indicated that reductions in the energy sold may drastically impair the feasibility of a wind energy generation project, and that increases in the lifetime of a project from 15 to 25 years may improve its feasibility. The minimum wind speed required to grant feasibility of investments on Terceira Island, for 1500 kW installed power, is 6 m/s, ceteris paribus.

Each of these load cases depends on combinations of at least three jointly distributed metocean parameters, the mean wind speed, the significant wave height, and the peak spectral period. In practice, these variables are commonly estimated for the 50-year extreme storm using a simple but coarse method, wherein 50-year values of wind speed and wave height are calculated independently and combined with a range of peak spectral period conditioned on the 50-year wave height. The IEC Standard does not provide detailed guidance on how to calculate the appropriate range of peak spectral period. Given the varying correlation of these parameters from site-to-site, this approach is clearly an approximation which is assumed to overestimate structural loads since wind and wave are combined without regard to their correlation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative multivariate method for assessing extreme storm conditions. The method is based on the Nataf model and the Inverse First Order Reliability Method (IFORM) and uses measurements or hindcasts of wind speed, wave height and peak spectral period to estimate an environmental surface which defines combinations of these parameters with a particular recurrence period. The method is illustrated using three sites along the U.S. Atlantic coast near Maine, Delaware and Georgia. Mudline moments are calculated using this new multivariate method for a hypothetical 5.

We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads (from a network operators perspective) with a strategy to minimize charging costs (from the perspective of a commercial party).

Therefore, we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and, consequently, on the resulting EV load and network impacts. We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value (NPV) of the investments costs and energy losses. We found that, in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices, the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25% higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized. The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration.

In this work, the value of energy storage for reducing such costs is studied. In particular, profit maximization is considered for a WPP who participates in a two-settlement (forward and real time) market and utilizes energy storage by charging/discharging it strategically. An infinite horizon discounted cost minimization problem for the optimal use of energy storage is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem that includes the past unfulfilled forward contracts in the state space. The optimal storage operation policy is shown to have a structure with two thresholds: after delivering its contracted power, if a WPP's energy falls below a lower threshold, it buys energy and charges its storage up to this threshold"	" if its energy exceeds a higher threshold, it sells the excess energy and maintains its storage level at this threshold. Several heuristics for solving the DP are derived based on approximating the problem model: a) a discrete policy based on discretizing the state and action space, and b) affine and look ahead policies derived by solving a Linear Quadratic (LQ) controller whose parameters are fit from the DP. The heuristics are tested both with simulated and real world wind and price data. It is observed that while the discrete optimal policy performs better on simulated data than either the look ahead or the affine policies (except with a very high battery capacity), the look ahead policy performs much better with real world data. This suggests that the performance of look ahead approximate optimal policy is more robust to the modeling errors and mismatch between analytic models and real data traces.

Large shares of VRE bring significant reductions on the operation time of flexible conventional plants and even lead to curtailments on renewable energy sources as well.

Therefore, this increase of installed capacity power cannot be exclusively based, e.g. in PV and/or wind plants, as the evening peak has to be covered every day. Such investments in VRE must then be backed up by new combined cycles. This also why STE could already be selected as the best choice in several Sun Belt countries.

Structural health monitoring systems represent promising instruments to assure reliability and good performance from the dynamics of the mechanical systems. However, such devices have not been completely perfected for spinning structures. These sensing technologies are typically informed by both mechanistic models coupled with data-driven identification techniques in the time and/or frequency domain. Frequency response functions are popular but are difficult to realize autonomously for structures of higher order, especially when overlapping frequency content is present. Instead, time-domain techniques have shown to possess powerful advantages from a practical point of view (i.e. low-order computational effort suitable for real-time or embedded algorithms) and also are more suitable to differentiate closely-related modes. Customarily, time-varying effects are often neglected or dismissed to simplify this analysis, but such cannot be the case for sinusoidally loaded structures containing spinning multi-bodies. A more complex scenario is constituted when dealing with both periodic mechanisms responsible for the vibration shaft of the rotor-blade system and the interaction of the supporting substructure. Transformations of the cyclic effects on the vibrational data can be applied to isolate inertial quantities that are different from rotation-generated forces that are typically non-stationary in nature. After applying these transformations, structural identification can be carried out by stationary techniques via data-correlated eigensystem realizations. In this paper, an exploration of a periodic stationary or cyclo-stationary subspace identification technique is presented here for spinning multi-blade systems by means of a modified Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) via stochastic subspace identification (SSI) and linear parameter time-varying (LPTV) techniques. Structural response is assumed to be stationary ambient excitation produced by a Gaussian (white) noise within the operative range bandwidth of the machinery or structure in study. ERA-OKID analysis is driven by correlation-function matrices from the stationary ambient response aiming to reduce noise effects. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigenvalue analysis are computed in a last stage to identify frequencies and complex-valued mode shapes. Proposed assumptions are carefully weighted to account for the uncertainty of the environment. A numerical example is carried out based a spinning finite element (SFE) model, and verified using ANSYS® Ver. 12. Finally, comments and observations are provided on how this subspace realization technique can be extended to the problem of modal-parameter identification using only ambient vibration data."""

The 10-min mean wind speed series are simulated based on translation process theory with prescribed Weibull distribution and power spectrum. The extreme response series are then generated using the distribution of extreme response under various mean wind speeds. The distribution of annual extreme response is determined from simulated samples and compared to that from distribution of short-term extreme. The results illustrate that the short-term extreme responses can be considered to be independent, while the mean wind speeds exhibit certain level of correlation. This study also presents improved methods for estimating long-term extreme response of parked turbines by using more accurate modeling of distribution tail of mean wind speed. A mixed distribution is suggested, which combines bulk distribution estimated from moderate wind speed data and tail distribution estimated by fitting the excesses above a given threshold with generalized Pareto and three parameters Weibull distributions.

Due to the influence of ground roughness, the wind shear exponents of different areas are different"	" in addition, because of the thermodynamic factor, the wind shear exponents are different even in the same area at different times. Therefore, to obtain an accurate value of the wind shear exponent in a certain area at a certain time, only the local wind-speed data can be used to calculate it. However, because of the complexity of the measured data, there are many methods to calculate the wind shear exponent, and the values calculated by different methods are different. So, in this paper, the methods of calculating wind shear exponent were studied. Firstly, there were five methods to calculate the wind shear exponent using different data sets, including 1) all of the data, 2) the data without wind speeds less than 3 m/s, 3) the data with the annual average wind speed, 4) the data with wind speeds between (15±0.5) m/s, 5) the wind profile. Among them, methods 1, 2, and 4 calculated wind shear exponent through the least-squares fitting. Method 3 used the annual average wind speed and the exponential formula to calculate wind shear exponent. Method 5 used wind profile fitting to calculate the wind shear exponent. The wind profile reflects the overall level of the wind conditions. Then, with the example of actual wind speed data, and within a complete year on three wind measurement heights at a mast of Wulanchabu in Inner Mongolia, five different wind shear exponents of this area were calculated by the above methods. Finally, according to the calculated wind shear exponents and the power-law formula, the wind speeds of the known height were calculated, and then by comparing the calculated value and actual value, the methods that produce smaller errors were chosen, and at last the more accurate wind shear exponent was obtained. The results showed that due to the impact of ground roughness and the topography, not only wind shear exponents were different in different areas, but they were also different when calculating by different methods even in the same area at the same time. The result of the method which used the data without wind speeds less than 3 m/s (method 2) for the least-squares fitting was more accurate than the result of the method which uses all of the data (method 1) for the least-squares fitting. The result calculated by the annual average wind speed (method 3) was close to the result calculated by using all of the data for the least-squares fitting. In the mountainous area, if it gets a negative wind shear exponent when calculated by the data with wind speeds between (15±0.5) m/s (method 4), the result will not be stable or reliable. Overall, the method of using the data without wind speeds less than 3 m/s calculated by the least-squares fitting and the method using wind profile fitting are more accurate than the other methods. Therefore, combining with the actual situation of wind farm, using these methods comprehensively to choose the smallest error wind shear exponent will provide the evaluation work with a more accurate foundation and ultimately achieve the goal of better utilization of wind resources."""

In fact, properly tuned lifting lines are key for the accurate simulation of wind energy systems, for example in the areas of performance, aeroelasticity and wake aerodynamics. The problem is formulated as the constrained optimization of a maximum likelihood cost function, driven by measurements of the rotor loads at the hub and possibly along the blades. Additive functions that correct the lift and drag characteristics of the blade airfoils are identified"	 such functions depend on the angle of attack and on the spanwise location along the blade, dependence that is approximated using suitable shape functions and their associated nodal parameters. The estimation problem expressed in terms of the physical nodal parameters is shown to be difficult and typically ill-posed, because of low observability and collinearity of the unknowns. To overcome this difficulty, a novel method is proposed that uses a singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix. By this decomposition, the problem is recast in terms of a new set of variables that are statistically independent	" in turn, this is used for readily selecting only those parameters that are associated with a sufficiently high level of confidence. The mapping between the new statistically independent and the original physical parameters is expressed by eigenshape functions, whose inspection clarifies which parameters are observable in which ranges of the angle of attack and blade span domain. The paper is complemented by examples that illustrate the main features of the proposed method. At first, a scaled rotor model is tested in a wind tunnel, and hub measurements are used for the calibration of its lifting line model, whose nominal characteristics appear to be largely in error. Much improvement in the fidelity of the lifting line is observed after calibration by the procedure described here. Next, a simulation study is conducted that illustrates the effects of multiple blade load measurements in the ability to spanwise localize the contributions of different airfoils. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."""

The hub height is 67 m above tower base or top of the jacket, i.e. 89 m above mean water level. The turbine response is numerically obtained by using the aerodynamic software HAWC2 and the hydrodynamic software USFOS. Two critical responses are discussed, the base shear force and the bending moment at the bottom of the jacket.

The calculation domain is a circular domain with a radius of 50c. The airfoil surface was set as an adiabatic no-slip wall boundary condition. A velocity-inlet boundary condition was applied at the inflow boundary and the pressure-outlet boundary condition was applied at the outflow boundary. The transition SST model can accurately predict the aerodynamic performance of conventional and blunt trailing edge airfoils with clean surfaces. The results calculated by the SST turbulence model can represent the aerodynamic performance of airfoils with rough surfaces. The steady calculated results show that the lift of clean airfoil can be predicted accurately by two dimensional CFD calculation while the drag of blunt trailing edge airfoils with larger trailing edge thickness cannot be calculated precisely even at low angles of attack. The aerodynamic performance of blunt trailing edge airfoils with larger trailing edge thickness should be predicted by more accurate three dimensional CFD method further. With the increase of the thickness of trailing edge, the increase rate and amount of lift becomes limited gradually at low angles of attack, while the drag increases dramatically. The larger the thickness of the trailing edge is, the higher the maximum lift is, but too large lift can cause abrupt stall. So the thickness of the trailing edge should be constrained in a certain rage. For example, 5%c is a better choice for blunt trailing edge airfoils, the lift of these airfoils has been increased but with no abrupt stall. In this paper, pressure distributions on original airfoils and trailing edge enlarged airfoils under ten degrees angles of attack calculated by both fully turbulent k-? SST model and transition k-? SST model were analyzed. On the one hand, by enlarging the trailing edge of the airfoil symmetrically, the adverse pressure gradient near trailing edge on suction side can be reduced, the reduced pressure gradient can suppress the reduction of flow velocity in boundary layer due to viscosity and the separation of boundary layer can be delayed consequently. On the other hand, the pressure differential between the pressure side and suction side can be increased. The increase of thicker airfoil's pressure differential is larger than other thinner airfoils. Besides, the increase amount of lift of trailing edge enlarged airfoils calculated by fully turbulent model is larger than that calculated by free transition turbulence model.

However, it will disturb the flow in the pump and affect the pump performance. Numerical simulation for 3D turbulence in whole flow passage of a centrifugal pump with back blades was carried out based on RANS method, with SST k-? turbulence model and SIMPLEC algorithm. Calculation for a similar pump without back blades was also carried out as a comparison. Boundary condition was improved due to the existence of back blade. The influence of back blades on the flow field was analysed qualitatively for three typical conditions. Meanwhile the leakage rate was calculated for several conditions and the effect of back blades was discussed. According to the results, compared with the condition without back blades, it could be seen that back blade apparently changed the flow state in the front chamber, improved near the front shroud and worsened near the pump cover. Velocity was increased and more fluid, which flowed into the front chamber from the pump cover side, flowed back to the spiral casing from the impeller shroud side. With the increase of discharge, the absolute value of leakage rate first went up and then dropped, as a consequence of the combination of two factors, discharge and differential pressure between the impeller outlet and inlet. The seal effect of back blades is most obvious under small discharge condition, and the leakage loss diminished as discharge increased. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."""

Orthogonal test method is a method which can make a comprehensive comparison among factors we are interested in. Thereby, it can't be more appropriate to adopt this approach to study the influence of the four factors referred above. Based on the prototype pump's geometric parameters, each of these factors took four levels. According to the principle of selecting orthogonal array, the L16(45) array was selected and 16 models were designed. After that, commercial CFD software CFX was used to calculate the head and efficiency under different conditions to determine the optimal operating condition Qr. The 16 models' rated flow rates were basically smaller than the prototype's. Considering this difference, in order to analyze the influence on the head under similar condition, the flow rate was made dimensionless and 3 conditions are chosen(Qr/Q=1, 1.25 and 1.375). Through the analysis of averaged respond head and efficiency, the laws of head and efficiency changing with the variation of the factors were obtained. Commonly, if a dependent's change cause by a independent variable is smaller than 5%, we can neglect the independent variable's effect. Thus the paper presents a research showing the factors' changing limitations considering the head changing by a percentage smaller than 5%.

These include wind farms located in disparate environments across the country. Locations are not always places that please naturalists or local people, since the presence of turbines may compromise valuable landscape-related or cultural features, even to the extent that the environment is harmed. There thus remains a need for cohesive research methodology by which to determine or identify areas predisposed for the location of wind farms subsequent to the specifi cities of given places having been taken fully into account. If such a methodology is developed, then it can be hoped that the negative impact of wind power plants will be limited, and local communities will be able to fi nd their own benefi ts arising out of their establishment. The purpose of this publication has thus been to discuss methodological assumptions underpinning the choice of locations for wind turbines, as these relate to legal, environmental, social, technical and resource-utilitarian criteria. These would then be available as a basis for proposing specifi c sites for windpower development within a given gmina (local authority area) located in the Polish Carpathians and serving as an example. The selected area is characterized by numerous environmental values in need of protection, but nevertheless partly given over for economic use (Fig. 1). There are many similar areas in the Polish Carpathians, so it is important that the limitations and possibilities that exist should be exemplifi ed for a far wider area. Tools of a geostatistical and geoinformatic nature were used in the study, analyses being performed on spatial data obtained in the form of maps, digital databases and a digital elevation model. Non-cartographic sources of information about the area were also used. An important stage to the work carried out entailed the adoption of values for the width of buffer zones around selected objects, not least because some of these value arise out of legislation in force, while others have been proposed by the authors. The degree of land suitability for the construction of wind turbines was determined using multi-criteria analysis (MCA), as method involving the use of criteria in the form of functions. Criteria were in turn analysed using the method of weighted linear combination (WLC), which offers a simple combination of layers based initially on the multiplication of parameters and the estimated weight of a given criterion, and then adding together the results of multiplications carried out for all criteria. Since the application of this method entails substantial subjectivity at the time weightings are assigned, additional use was made of a hierarchical method of analysis of a problem (AHP = the analytic hierarchy process, as developed by T. Saaty (Bryndza, 2006). Finally, layers corresponding to location factors were standardized and, as a result of multiplying the standardized layers by estimated weights followed by the summation of the results, a map of land suitability for investment was generated in two variants: for the conditions associated with the presence of power lines (Fig. 6A), and allowing for the distance from the main points of power supply (Fig. 6B). These maps reveal a dichotomy within the gmina of Rymanów, which is seen to have a southern zone of lesser suitability of land, and a northern one manifesting higher values for the suitability parameter. However, this does not mean that no energy developments at all can be implemented in the southern zone. Rather, it will be necessary for a number of legal, social, environmental and technical barriers to be overcome, this usually in practice denoting higher cost effectiveness. Equally, areas in the central part of the gmina should clearly be excluded from such activity. The proposed methodology of multi-criteria analysis for the selection of areas for aero-energy development takes account of the broader principles of sustainable development in the different types of natural landscape in Poland."""

Health monitoring systems are very promising instruments to assure reliability and good performance of the structure. These sensing and control technologies are typically informed by models based on mechanics or data-driven identification techniques in the time and/or frequency domain. Frequency response functions are popular but are difficult to realize autonomously for structures of higher order and having overlapping frequency content. Instead, time-domain techniques have shown powerful advantages from a practical point of view (e.g. embedded algorithms in wireless-sensor networks), being more suitable to differentiate closely-related modes. Customarily, time-varying effects are often neglected or dismissed to simplify the analysis, but such is not the case for wind loaded structures with spinning multi-bodies. A more complex scenario is constituted when dealing with both periodic mechanisms responsible for the vibration shaft of the rotor-blade system, and the wind tower substructure interaction. Transformations of the cyclic effects on the vibration data can be applied to isolate inertia quantities different from rotating-generated forces that are typically non-stationary in nature. After applying these transformations, structural identification can be carried out by stationary techniques via data-correlated Eigensystem realizations.

This, in turn, influences the accuracy of wind resource assessment. The frequency analysis techniques commonly used to study wind variability cannot represent the autocorrelation properties of wind speeds and thus provide no information on the probabilities of occurrence of such sustained, low wind events. We present two complementary methods for assessing wind variability, runs analysis and intensity-duration- frequency analysis, both with emphasis on characterising the occurrence of continuous, extended periods (up to several days) of low wind speeds. Multi-annual time series of hourly wind speeds from meteorological stations in Ireland are analysed with both techniques.

However, to explore its implications effectively, variability itself should first be clearly understood. This is particularly true for national electricity systems with high planned penetrations of renewables and limited interconnection such as the UK.Variability cannot be considered as a distinct resource property with a single measurable parameter, but is a multi-faceted concept best described by a range of distinct characteristics. This paper identifies relevant characteristics of variability, and considers their implications for energy research. This is done through analysis of wind, solar and tidal current resources, with a primary focus on the Bristol Channel region in the UK. The relationship with electricity demand is considered, alongside the potential benefits of resource diversity.Analysis is presented in terms of persistence, distribution, frequency and correlation between supply and demand. Marked differences are seen between the behaviours of the individual resources, and these give rise to a range of different implications for system integration. Wind shows strong persistence and a useful seasonal pattern, but also a high spread in energy levels at time scales beyond one or two days. The solar resource is most closely correlated with electricity demand, but is undermined by night-time zero values and an even greater spread of monthly energy delivered than wind. In contrast, the tidal resource exhibits very low persistence, but also much greater consistency in energy values assessed across monthly time scales.Whilst this paper focuses primarily on the behaviour of resources, it is noted that discrete variability characteristics can be related to different system impacts. Persistence and predictability are relevant for system balancing, whereas statistical distribution is more relevant when exploring issues of asset utilisation and energy curtailment.

To increase the density of the power production in the farm, the deployment of wave energy converters (WECs) in the spaces between FWTs could be considered. However, the cost of energy from WECs is still very large. Therefore, the deployments of the WECs will reduce the economic value of the total project. In the present paper, a combined concept involving a combination of Spar-type FWTs and an axi-symmetric two-body WECs is considered. Compared with segregated deployments of FWTs and WECs, this combined concept would imply reduced capital costs of the total project because it will reduce the number of power cables, mooring line and the structural mass of the WECs. However, the effect of the addition of a Torus (donut-shape heaving buoy) on the FWT's motions as well as the power production should first be investigated. In the present study, coupled (wave- and wind-induced response-mooring) analysis is performed using SIMO/TDHMILL3D in the time domain to study the motion behaviour of the combined concept and to estimate the power production from both FWT and WEC under operational conditions. Mooring tension in the combined concept is also compared with the mooring tension in the Spar-type FWT alone. Hydrodynamic loads are determined using HydroD. The validated simplified method called TDHMILL is implemented to calculate the aerodynamic forces as a function of the relative wind velocity. The analysis is performed for several operational conditions according to metocean data taken in the Statfjord field in the North Sea. Finally, the behaviour of the combined concept under operational conditions is assessed, and it is shown to result in a positive synergy between wind and wave energy generation in terms of both capital investment and power production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."""

A full-scale 2.5 MW wind turbine airfoil section, typical for the near tip, was placed in the free stream flow of the wind tunnel at the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory, University of Minnesota. Various sizes and geometries of experimental riblets were provided by 3M Company and tested at angles of attack ranging from 0° ? ? ? 10° (0.25 ? C L ? 1.14) and at a Reynolds number of Re = 2.2 × 10 6. Mean drag was measured via wake survey (momentum deficit) and with a sensitive force balance. Lift was measured directly from the force balance. Tests included the cases of complete and partial riblet coverage on the wing. Results indicated that riblets could provide an overall reduction of skin friction drag, and that the amount of the decrease varied with riblet height and geometry. Partial riblet coverage appears in some cases more efficient than its complete coverage counterpart. The percentage of drag the riblets reduced varied greatly and in some cases the riblets were even detrimental to the airfoil. The most efficient riblet for a completely covered airfoil was found to be the V-groove shape of 100 ?m height. It produced a reduction of roughly 6% in the operational range expected in a turbine airfoil. On the other hand, the most efficient riblet size for partial coverage was also a V-groove shape and seemed to shift slightly to a smaller peak height of 80 ?m. This configuration produced a reduction of roughly 4% in the range of angle of attack that is typical for operation in the field. The average non-dimensional square root of the groove cross-section, l +, defined in terms of the drag coefficient at design angle of attack for the optimum riblet configuration in the fully coverage case was found to be l +?10, which is very close to the optimum value found for planar surfaces. Based on our results we propose a formulation for the optimum riblet size in airfoil considering the mean drag coefficient and chord length Reynolds number. Even though the optimum full coverage case showed better performance that the partial case, the additional drag reduction benefit may be offset by the additional application cost. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."""

Distributed wind energy applications are an attractive option in some Mid- Atlantic States and may be the key to unlocking the potential of a large and economically viable resource. Although the economic value of distributed wind plants is not significantly less than elsewhere, especially in coastal areas, deployment has been slow. Two issues that contribute to this apathetic growth are discussed in this paper. First, there is a general lack of wind resource measurement data especially at potentially good wind sites and therefore existing sources and models may be under predicting the potential. Early regional wind maps showed marginal wind energy potential at 50 meter height. Today it is known that better resources exist at hub height and above on today's commercial turbines. Second, the Federal wind program focused most attention on defined resources the Midwest. Another reason for slow growth is that weak policies act as a deterrent to the entire multistate region. In Maryland and Virginia, existing renewable portfolio programs can be satisfied with renewable energy credits (""""RECs"""") generated by projects that existed long before the portfolio standards or can be purchased elsewhere in the country (except solar RECs must originate Maryland). Crediting pre-existing biomass projects with RECs diminishes the efficacy of portfolio programs. North Carolina limits REC to new sources but has conservative goals and other limitations due to view-shed issues. Maryland recently introduced net metering rules that are attractive to wind and solar by allowing some customers to sell electricity back up to 200% of the normal consumption. The price is retail or about 8-10 cents/kWh less transport and administration fees. This is allowed for projects smaller than two megawatts. As the flaws in the renewable portfolio programs are fixed and the significant economic value of the existing incentives are recognized, distributed wind is likely to be the precursor to large scale wind deployment in the mid-Atlantic region.

Here, we present an alternative view of maintenance as a value-driver, and develop an optimization algorithm to maximize the value delivered by maintenance. We model the stochastic deterioration of the turbine in two dimensions: the deterioration rate, and the extent of deterioration, and view maintenance as an operator that moves the turbine to an improved state in which it can generate more power and so earn more revenue. We then use a standard net present value (NPV) approach to calculate the value of the turbine by deducting the costs incurred in the installation, operations and maintenance from the revenue due to the power generation. The application of our model is demonstrated using several scenarios with a focus on blade deterioration. We evaluate the value delivered by implementing blade condition monitoring systems (CMS).

The difference between the value of the turbine with and without CMS can be interpreted as the value of the CMS. The results indicate that a higher fidelity (and more expensive) condition monitoring system (CMS) does not necessarily yield the highest value, and, that there is an optimal level of fidelity that results in maximum value. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it is a practical approach to wind turbine valuation and operation that takes operating and market conditions into account.

Flow separation often causes undesirable phenomena such as an increase of the total pressure loss and a vibration of the machine. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of the separated flow in detail is very important for optimizing the machine to decrease the energy loss. In general, the separated flow involves a reverse flow near the solid wall in the separation bubble and its reattachment of the further downstream location. Hence, a typical hot-wire sensor is not useful for measuring the internal separated flow between the blades because it can detect only the magnitude of the flow velocity, not the flow direction. Based on this background, a self-developed tandem-type hot-wire sensor, by which both the magnitude and the flow direction can be detected, is used to measure the velocity field between the blades in this study. The tandem-type hot-wire sensor consists of two I-type hot-wire sensors and a small insulated elliptical cylinder placed between them. A calibration test is first conducted to validate its performance. Subsequently, the separated flow between the blades is measured with the tandem-type hot-wire sensor. The experimental apparatus consists of a closed-type test section which is connected to the nozzle exit of a blowout-type wind tunnel. In this test section, a sample of blade is set up. In this study, experiments are conducted with three kinds of blades with the different shapes (i.e., experiments are performed under three different conditions): a constant blade thickness from the leading edge to the trailing edge (Blade 1), a constant blade thickness from the leading edge to trailing edge but a rounded leading edge (Blade 2) and a thin blade thickness at the leading and trailing edges (Blade 3). In addition, the unsteady internal separated flow between the blades is also investigated by large-eddy simulation (LES) whose validity was fully confirmed in the previous study. The flow field and dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy obtained by the simulation are discussed. Experimental and numerical results show that Blade 3 has a smallest separation bubble around the leading edge than that of Blade 1 and 2, and shows a smallest root mean square (RMS) value for the velocity fluctuation near the reattachment point than them. These differences of the size of separation bubble and velocity fluctuation were considered to be resulted in a decrease of the kinetic energy loss in the test section with Blade 3.

This paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radio astronomy with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), with a focus on imaging observations. Methods. We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI) situation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz with low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a subset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed with a 0.76 kHz/1 s resolution. Results. We measured the RFI occupancy in the low and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. These values are found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of 0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. This rate increases approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution. Conclusions. Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR"	 accurate detection methods	 strong filters and high receiver linearity	" and the proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent.

The Brazilian power system is mainly hydro based and, due to its many singularities, its coordination is still centralized. A collateral effect of such centralized dispatch coordination is that the system marginal costs, which determine the short-term energy prices, exhibit a highly volatile pattern. In this setting, selling energy through bilateral forward contracts backed up on intermittent generation profiles, such as wind farms and small-run hydros, exposes the generation company (Genco) to the so-called price-quantity risk.

This power coefficient is determined by the Tip Speed Ratio (TSR), which characterizes the air flow around the blade.

A PJM study from 2009 showed the introduction of 15 GW of wind resources in PJM would reduce average LMPs by $5/MWh. Lower LMPs in the PJM Energy Market will have the effect of reducing net energy market revenues that can be earned by conventional fossil generation resources and place such resources at a greater risk for retirement unless sufficient revenue can be earned elsewhere in PJM's markets. If conventional fossil resources can earn sufficient revenues in PJM's Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) Capacity Market that make up for reduced net energy market revenues, then conventional fossil generation can and will remain a large part of the generation resource mix. However, conventional fossil generation would, through higher RPM Capacity Market prices, provide greater value as Capacity Resources than as energy resources in the presence of widespread penetration of renewable generation resources. Such a transition makes sense as renewable generation resources are intermittent in their output and are given a considerable discount off their nameplate capacity values as Capacity Resources due to their intermittency. Yet, given renewable portfolio standard (RPS) and production tax credit policies, renewable resources have greater value based on their energy output, value beyond net energy revenues that can be earned in PJM's Energy market, than as a Capacity Resources. The current economic and policy environment provides a preview of the evolving value of conventional fossil generation from energy towards capacity. As a recent PJM study has shown, coal-fired generation in PJM has seen a dramatic decline in net energy market revenues as the recession and declining natural gas prices have reduced the value of energy from these resources.

The expected benefit of lidar-based control lies in reduced structural and component loading. While research has been carried out to evaluate these benefits, how such benefits will translate to financial gains is not always clear. This paper estimates the profitability of various approaches to maximizing the benefits of lidar-based control. This study was funded by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) [1]. Industry and academic research and prototype test results were reviewed and aggregated to develop expectations for improvements in performance and loads via lidar-based control. These improvements were applied to (1) life extension, (2) rotor diameter increase, or (3) tower height increase. Other impacts on net present value (NPV) were accounted for such as capital costs, impacts on turbine availability and operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. A cost model was developed using an NPV approach and the cost of energy to compare a lidar-case to the base-case cost of energy. Numerous studies have suggested that lidar technology has the potential to improve wind turbine power capture and decrease loads over the life of a turbine by providing the controller advanced knowledge of the incoming wind field. In this study, projected performan ce improvements and load reduction benefits through lidar-based individual pitch and yaw control were synthesized from numerous recent peer-reviewed publications and published experimental results. Based on the theoretical reduction in loading described in the papers, a cost benefit analysis was run for three scenarios, and the resulting impact on levelized cost of energy was determined. In scenario one, the life of an already-installed turbine is extended through the use of lidar-based controls to reduce loads that limit the design life of the turbine. In scenarios two and three, the expected load reduction benefits under lidar-based control are absorbed by a larger rotor diameter and a taller tower, respectively. In all three scenarios, more energy is captured at the expense of increases in capital and O&M costs. Considerations in all scenarios included improved power capture due to better wind direction and gust tracking, impacts on O&M costs, additional O&M costs for the lidar itself, impacts on availability, and added capital costs. Analysis shows that the use of lidar-based control has the potential to reduce the levelized cost of energy significantly.

This turbulence is used to create inflow conditions to NREL's FAST code to study the differences in wind turbine loadings. Through examination of different wind turbine parameters, we observe differences between the kinematic and dynamic turbulence flow fields. In particular, we find that the predicted mean values for rotor power and lift are very similar between the two turbulence fields. However, the variance inherent in the LES turbulence is not found within the TurbSim kinematic turbulence. Matching the TurbSim mean Reynolds stresses to those of the LES flow field does not cause the correlations between wind velocity and turbine loadings to match.

A supercapacitor has a higher power density than that of battery, allowing the supercapacitor to provide more power over a short period of time. This study examines the feasibility of using supercapacitors to improve the stability of power generation in CPV systems. Supercapacitors are incorporated into the CPV module circuit. The equivalent circuit of a single solar cell with a supercapacitor is then constructed and simulated for determining the optimized capacitance of the supercapacitors. Simulation results indicate that a module circuit with 10F supercapacitor can significantly increase the stability of the output voltage waveform under the condition of a tracking error around 0.3°. Moreover, the output voltage decreases only around 4%, with the tracking error around 0.3°.

Experimental and analytical results were in excellent qualitative agreement: turbines with shorter blades produced more power than those with longer blades consistently, which is the reverse of what might be expected when turbines are subjected to uniform wind speeds. Results indicate that the zone in which power output increases with increasing radii necessitated speeds that were not reached in the tests that were conducted. © 2012 WIETE."""

The ADV measured flows consisted of wind induced currents, wave induced orbital motions and turbulence. Maximum of wind induced currents reached up to 10-15 cm/s, while the maximum near bed orbital motions peaked over 40 cm/s. From the comparison of ADV, turbidity and wave characteristics it followed that turbidity was clearly depending on the wave energy. It means only long and quite high waves generating bottom orbital velocities (calculated from the wave gauge data and/or measured using ADV) over 20 cm/s were able to resuspend bottom sediment and induce some increase in turbidity values - 5-12 NTU in stormy days. Sediment fluxes were estimated using measuring data, sediment characteristics and BBL model. It followed from the modeling results that the height of all BBL varied from 1 cm to 10 cm, and the height of the bottom-most layer (skin friction layer) varied from 0.01 cm to 1 cm.

The results showed that capacity factors of the two turbines in the selected sites ranged between 4.6 and 43%. Average minimum cost per kW. h was obtained in Kano as $0.0222/kW. h with AN Bonus 1. MW while the highest average cost is $0.2074/kW. h with AN Bonus 300. kW in Kaduna. The highest cost in each of the location was obtained with the medium WECs (AN Bonus 300. kW). In addition, Kano and Katsina were also found to be very economical for any of the adopted wind turbine models. Gusau and Kaduna, at cost of unit energy of about $0.30/kW. h were found to be more profitable for non-connected electrical and mechanical applications (water pumping, battery charging) than diesel generator. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."""

So that it is desirable to trade-off between optimum utilization of intermittent generation resources (i.e. renewable energy resources), uncertain market prices and related risks in order to maximize participants benefits and minimize the corresponding risks in the multi-product market environment. The main goal of this paper is to investigate risk management by introducing a novel multi-risk index to quantify expected downside risk (EDR) which is caused by both the wind power and market price uncertainties. Value-at-Risk (VaR) method is used to assess the mentioned risk issue by the proposed weighted EDR, so that an optimal trade-off between the profit and risk is made for the system operations. Also, the roulette wheel mechanism is employed for random market price scenario generation wherein the stochastic procedure is converted into its respective deterministic equivalents.

The fitness value is functionalized by combining the objective function, penalty function, and the aggregated fuzzy membership function. After clustering, each solution is updated according to the velocity and position BPSO refinement functions.

Kinmen used to be a key military location of high strategic value, and witnessed some decisive victories battles. However, owing to rapid developments in the worldwide landscape and changes in cross-strait relations, Kinmen has been transformed from a high-alert military fortification to a famous group of islands that attract many tourists. In the last few years, the issue of climate change has increased the public's environmental awareness. In dedication to this issue, Kinmen is aggressively pursuing the construction of an energy-efficiency management network. As the current overall power supply for the Kinmen mainly from thermal power, Kinmen is hoping that by developing greener sources of energy it can play a role in the worldwide campaign to address the problems of global warming. In order to achieve the goal, the first focus should be on the best method of making good use of the natural resources of the islands - solar and wind power - and the integration of these natural resources with the unique resource of the islands - military installations. Kinmen needs to rethink the application and management of the regeneration of the abandoned military installations. By applying the approach proposed in this paper, Kinmen could develop a renewable energy scheme with distributed power systems to replace the centralized power plants.

This article uses the real options technique to find the economically desirable start-up dates for three carbon-free methods of generating electricity, nuclear, onshore wind, and offshore wind, when facing competition from electricity generated from natural gas. The fact that the same assessment method has been used for each of the three carbon-free options allows intercomparability of the results. Nuclear power is projected to become competitive with gas-based electricity in 2015, even when no benefit is claimed for its carbon-free properties. Using the same yardstick, unaided onshore wind power first becomes competitive with gas in 2032 and unaided offshore wind power in 2040. There is thus a wide disparity among the dates of competiveness for the three methods of generation considered. Judged on a level playing field for carbon-free technologies, nuclear power emerges as a much better investment than onshore wind, while onshore wind is better than offshore wind. The analysis provides an explanation for the significant number of utilities who have declared an interest in New Nuclear Build in the UK in the near future. It shows that these utilities can be expected to make money immediately after their plants start up, even if they are given no credit for the carbon-free nature of nuclear generation. By contrast, the economics of wind power look more problematic. Even given the current level of intervention, £40/MWh, equivalent to £90/t CO2 avoided, onshore wind farms are not expected to become competitive with gas generation for about 15 years. That timescale stretches to over 20 years if no intervention is made. The situation is worse for offshore wind farms, which do not become competitive until 2028 even when given twice the aid offered to onshore wind farms: £80/MWh, equivalent to £180/t CO2 avoided. Without this high level of support, offshore wind farms are not expected to become competitive with gas generation for nearly 30 years even when allowance is made for the improved technology associated with series build. While wind technology is likely eventually to become competitive with gas, the real options analysis suggests that it would require significant cost reductions for a major, early deployment of wind power to become justified. It would appear to be a particularly questionable use of resources to spend money developing offshore wind farms so far in advance of their likely cost-effectiveness. The real options analysis suggests that large-scale construction of offshore wind farms should be delayed until the late 2030s. © Authors 2011."""

Despite the considerable uncertainties in current estimates, the analysis provides evidence of the worth of the J-value methodology, particularly in relation to its ability to take explicit account of loss of life expectancy in evaluating delayed health effects. Risks are delineated according to two dimensions: whether the risk is occupational or public, and whether the risk is immediate or delayed. Impacts are also assessed for major accidents. The results indicate that nuclear generally has the lowest impacts, while gas, onshore wind and offshore wind have indicative impacts that are about an order of magnitude greater, although the estimates for both wind technologies carry considerable uncertainty. Coal power was found to present high impacts compared with the other technologies, mainly as a result of pollution emissions, even though the potential harm from some emissions has not been included because the effects are not fully understood. Total nuclear impacts were found to be sensitive to assumptions regarding the use of collective dose and the assumptions which are then used to calculate impacts. For the most pessimistic case, when world exposures are taken, total nuclear impacts increase by about an order of magnitude, which would render the risks from nuclear generation comparable with those from gas and wind generation. © Authors 2011."""

First, power smoothing based on a traditional Inertial Filter is introduced and the relationship between the time constant, its smoothing effect and capacity allocation are analyzed and combined with Proportional Integral Differential (PID) control to realize power smoothing control of wind power. Then wavelet theory is adopted to realize a multi-layer decomposition of power output in some wind farms, a power smoothing model based on hybrid energy storage technology is constructed combining the characteristics of the Super Capacitor (SC) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) technologies. The hybrid energy storage system is available for power fluctuations with high frequency-low energy and low frequency-high energy to achieve good smoothing effects compared with a single energy storage system. The power fluctuations filtered by the Wavelet Transform is regarded as the target value of BESS, the charging and discharging control for battery is completed quickly by Model Algorithm Control (MAC). Because of the influence of the inertia and the response speed of the battery, its actual output is not completely equal to the target value which mainly reflects in high-frequency part, the difference part uses SC to compensate and makes the output of battery and SC closer to the target value on the whole. Compared with the traditional Inertial Filter and PID control method, the validity of the model was verified by simulation results. Finally under the premise of power grid standards, the corresponding capacity design had been given to reduce the size of the energy storage devices as far as possible, which has a certain practical engineering value. © 2012 by the authors."""

We use kernel density estimation to produce a probabilistic wind power forecast, whereas uncertainties in DA and RT prices are assumed to be Gaussian.

There are two main motivations for considering such systems: firstly the lifetime cost per kW h exported has the potential to be substantially lower than the lifetime cost per kW h of a system generating electricity directly. Secondly these systems offer the intrinsic capability to store large amounts of energy in a very cost effective way. The only marginal costs associated with energy storage are those connected with providing some means for storing the compressed air and some means for managing heat. This paper describes an approach to simulating the performance of such systems including a controller to determine how much power to generate at a given time and it explains an appropriate rationale for the design of that controller. The simulations conducted indicate three remarkable performance measures. Specifically: (a) the marginal loss of energy associated with passing some energy through storage may be below 15% even with energy residency times in the order of months, (b) the marginal increase in total output electrical energy arising from integrating some solar heat capture can be as high as 60% of the captured solar heat for solar heat inputs up to 5% of total mechanical power and (c) the average value of the total power output may easily be raised by over 30% if power values continue to fluctuate at rates exhibited today and if the capacity for expansion-generation matches the peak input power of the primary (mechanical) energy harvesters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."""

They provide reliable data on ocean surface currents and under slightly stricter conditions can also give information on ocean waves. Although extraction of wind direction is possible, estimation of wind speed poses a challenge. Existing methods estimate wind speed indirectly from the radar derived ocean wave spectrum, which is estimated from the second-order sidebands of the radar Doppler spectrum. The latter is extracted at shorter ranges compared with the first-order signal, thus limiting the method to short distances. Given this limitation, we explore the possibility of deriving wind speed from radar first-order backscatter signal. Two new methods are developed and presented that explore the relationship between wind speed and wave generation at the Bragg frequency matching that of the radar. One of the methods utilizes the absolute energy level of the radar first-order peaks while the second method uses the directional spreading of the wind generated waves at the Bragg frequency. For both methods, artificial neural network analysis is performed to derive the interdependence of the relevant parameters with wind speed. The first method is suitable for application only at single locations where in situ data are available and the network has been trained for while the second method can also be used outside of the training location on any point within the radar coverage area. Both methods require two or more radar sites and information on the radio beam direction. The methods are verified with data collected in Fedje, Norway, and the Ligurian Sea, Italy using beam forming HF WEllen RAdar (WERA) systems operated at 27.68 and 12.5 MHz, respectively. The results show that application of either method requires wind speeds above a minimum value (lower limit). This limit is radar frequency dependent and is 2.5 and 4.0 m/s for 27.68 and 12.5 MHz, respectively. In addition, an upper limit is identified which is caused by wave energy saturation at the Bragg wave frequency. Estimation of this limit took place through an evaluation of a year long database of ocean spectra generated by a numerical model (third generation WAM). It was found to be at 9.0 and 11.0 m/s for 27.68 and 12.5 MHz, respectively. Above this saturation limit, conventional second-order methods have to be applied, which at this range of wind speed no longer suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios.

In this article, we analyse the potential applicability of solar and wind energy to provide power for water desalination. In two illustrative examples, we assess the feasibility of supplying 3% of Sydney's projected total water consumption (supplied at an average rate of 24.7 Gl/yr) and 5% of Sydney's projected water consumption (supplied at an average rate of 32.7 Gl/yr) over a 15-yr period (2011-2025) using a photovoltaic (PV) solar powered (130 MW) and a hybrid (PV solar and wind energy) powered (205 MW) reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants, respectively. In addition to supplying cleaner energy, the renewable energy sources considered in this article have additional cost advantages in the presence of a carbon penalty. For example, at hypothetical carbon penalty rates of $20/tCO 2 and $30/tCO 2, the estimated cost savings-in net present value (NPV) terms assuming a discount rate of 4.2%-of the PV solar (hybrid) plant will amount to around be $18.7 m ($25.2 m) and $28.0 m ($37.9 m), respectively, over the 15-yr period, relative to a situation where the desalination plant is instead being powered by black coal. Under a discount rate of 8.4%, the cost savings of the PV solar (hybrid) plant associated with carbon penalty rates of $20/tCO 2 and $30/tCO 2 are estimated to be around $12.8 m ($17.6 m) and $19.2 m ($26.4 m), respectively, in NPV terms. Our analysis also shows that in addition to providing the required power supply for the illustrative desalination plants, the renewable energy supply sources analysed here would produce excess electricity that could be sold to a nearby grid. Consequently, assuming a wholesale electricity price of $36.74/MWh, the PV solar plant and the hybrid renewable plant are estimated to have the capacity to earn around $63.9 million and $110.0 million in NPV terms, respectively, over the 15-yr period, through excess electricity sales.

The emission-based indicators (IMSIEB) capture the impact of mobile sources on air quality estimated from receptor models and their uncertainty is comparable to measurement and source apportionment uncertainties. The IMSIEB have larger correlation between two different receptor sites impacted by traffic than single pollutants, suggesting they are better indicators of the local impact of mobile sources.

Global dynamic motion responses have been analyzed by aero-hydro-servo-elastic time-domain simulations. The aerodynamics is based on an advanced blade element momentum theory. Panel method and Morison formula accounting for the instantaneous position of the structure are applied for hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamic drag and considering geometrical updating introduce nonlinearities. Hydrodynamic nonlinearities were found to cause excitation of the natural frequencies in the low frequency range more than in the wave frequency range. Extrapolation methods are applied to estimate the maximum responses. A previous study showed that the uncertainty of such an extrapolation for the present concept is less than 2%. In this study it is found that the mean values of the dynamic responses are primarily wind induced and the standard deviations of the responses are primarily wave induced. However, the standard deviation of the nacelle surge motion under operational conditions is primarily wind induced. The maximum of the responses under operational and survival conditions are wind induced and wave induced, respectively. For the present turbine, a power of 5MWcan be achieved at a mean wind speed greater than 15 m/s, whereas the rated wind speed for the original land-based wind turbine is approximately 11 m/s. It is found that the wind turbulence does not affect the dynamic motion and structural responses significantly. However, turbulence affects power production. The ratio of the bending moment and the shear force in the tower-spar interface under a 100-year environmental condition to the corresponding responses associated with the rated wind speed can be as high as 1.5 and 2.3, respectively. It is therefore important to consider survival environmental conditions in the ultimate limit state checks of floating turbines, whereas operational conditions are normally most critical for land-based wind turbines. Moreover, it is shown that under survival conditions, the normalized maximum responses, i.e., (maximum mean)/(standard deviation), corresponding to an upcrossing rate of 0.0001 based on five 1-h analyses varies between 4 and 6, whereas for operational cases the normalized maximum varies between 2 and 4. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers."""

For the device analyzed here, the modeling is first described and then the Motion Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) are computed. From these motion responses, the theoretical mechanical power available is calculated. The power values depend on empirical coefficients that need to be confirmed through model testing in the lab. The hydrodynamic forces on each device are often dependent on the interference between the device and the hull, the mooring, and the non-linear effects which are challenging to model. Therefore, these forces are approximated using a Morrison-type formulation in the numerical models. The empirical values for drag coefficients, damping coefficients, and stiffness coefficients in this report are validated against model tests, which are also described.

These advantages include: zero VOCs, sustainable raw materials from renewable resources (soy), faster infusion times, and superior tensile fatigue, interlaminar fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth. For example, in tensile fatigue the polyurethane-based composite outperformed VE and epoxy by as much as 9 and 14.8 order of magnitudes. Whereas, at a peak load of 10,000 psi the epoxy fractured at 93,216 cycles and the VE at 57,507 cycles, while the polyurethane fractured only after 849,881 cycles.

The main wind hazards contributing to economic loss in Australia are tropical cyclones, thunderstorms and mid-latitude storms. Geoscience Australia's Environmental Geoscience Division (EGD) has developed mathematical models to study a number of natural hazards including wind hazard. In this paper we describe a methodology to study """"combined"""" gust wind hazard produced by thunderstorm and mid-latitude or synoptic storms. The methodology is aimed at applications in regions where these two wind types dominate the hazard spectrum across all return periods (most of the Australian continent apart from the coastal region stretching north from about 27°S where the hazard for large return periods is dominated by tropical cyclones). Each of these severe wind types is generated by different physical phenomena and poses a different hazard to the built environment. For these reasons, it is necessary to model them separately. The return period calculated for each wind type is then combined probabilistically to produce the combined gust wind return period, the indicator used to quantify severe wind hazard. The combined wind hazard model utilises climate model simulated wind speeds and hence it allows wind analysts to assess the impact of climate change on future wind hazard. It aims to study severe wind hazard in the non-cyclonic regions of Australia which is the region 'A', as defined in the Australian/NZ Wind Loading Standard (AS/NZS 1170.2:2011). This region is dominated by thunderstorm and synoptic winds. The synoptic wind component of the combined wind hazard comprises three sub-models: • A technique to extract and process mean wind speeds from a high-resolution regional climate model. The climate model used in these studies provides maximum time-step wind speeds each hour at a resolution of 14 km, which does not resolve thunderstorms or tropical cyclones. • A Monte Carlo method to generate gust wind speeds from the climate-modelled mean wind speeds"	" and • A statistical model to quantify wind hazard in terms of return period using extreme value distributions. The analysis of the thunderstorm wind hazard is made using the observational data from a number of Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) recording stations located around the country. Thunderstorm wind speeds are extracted by matching BoM weather description and wind speed datasets. An extreme value analysis is made on this dataset and the parameters of the resulting Generalised Pareto Distributions are interpolated spatially. This technique can be used to assess thunderstorm hazard under current climate conditions. For future climate, the model extracts two parameters from the regional climate model: the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and wind speed (surface and vertical profile). Using these two parameters it is possible to make an assessment of the likelihood of the formation of severe thunderstorms. The model allows estimation of possible changes in thunderstorm frequency and hence an assessment of thunderstorm wind hazard under future climate conditions, under the assumption that the intensity of thunderstorm downbursts remains constant. To illustrate the methodology, severe wind hazard calculations under current and future climate conditions for the Australian state of Tasmania will be presented. The results show increases particularly in the regions which currently have high hazard. This increase is however not uniform across the state and is more apparent in the later part of the 21 st century (greater greenhouse gas emissions forcing) than in the early part. Implications of this projected change for building standards will be discussed. © Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia) 2011."""

Doppler analysis on the scattered sound indicates the radial velocity of the turbulent fluctuations and combining multiple radial components yields a wind velocity profile. These profiles are particularly useful for the wind energy sector. Range and velocity resolution are common limitations of SODAR. To overcome these problems new signal processing methods are to be developed. To provide a test bed for the evaluation of the signal processing methods, a model is developed which simulates the scattering of an acoustic pulse by moving temperature fluctuations, analogous to monostatic SODAR (receiver and transmitter co-located).

Traditionally, wind shear parameters are derived either from local velocity measurements at two or more heights or from surface roughness characteristics to predict the wind speed at hub height for a particular site. However, recent measurements in a complex terrain (non-mountainous) region indicate that the measured wind shear exponent is significantly higher than the value predicted by land use characteristics and modeled results. Virtual wind shear parameters: alpha and zo, created by the modeled flow fields of the complex terrain of southeastern Ohio's Appalachian foothills are determined with computational fluid dynamics simulations designed for complex terrain. Then the first year's measurements from the extra-tall tower in the region provide a direct evaluation of the wind shear parameters: alpha and z o. These values, characteristic of the measurements, are compared against values determined from the local land use characteristics as well as those found by modeling with a computational fluid dynamics wind simulator.

It is demonstrated that for this site an overall annual average value of the wind shear coefficient is an inaccurate representation of the wind shear because of the range of variability that occurs seasonally.

Interestingly, the multi-member extension of Powles' tower shadow model with the square-root law is found to be adequate for the truss tower at moderate distances, and we suggest parameter values that better reproduce the velocities encountered by the blades in such circumstances.

In each case, the temperature and velocity contours of the combustion gases are examined along the transition piece and outlet section, comparing the radial and circumferential velocity and temperature profiles. In this study, it is important to know the temperature and velocity profiles at the outlet of the transition piece, because they have impact on the vanes and blades of the first stage of the gas turbine. The study considers a steady state three-dimensional model, using FLUENT® version 6.3.26 and a code of genetic algorithms where the geometric parameters were analyzed. To obtain the results, a structured grid about 5.1 million cells with second-order upwind scheme and coupled solver was applied. The results show the effect of the geometry of the transition piece in the velocity and temperature profiles at the outlet area, where the change of the cross sectional area influences the contours. A smooth change in the cross sectional section allows a uniform temperature and velocity distribution at the outlet section of the transition piece. The peak value of the temperature is decreased about 5.5% (11.4 K) in the radial direction whereas the velocity is decreased 3.62% (4.27 m/s). The peak value of the temperature in the circumferential direction is decreased about 3.33% (45.51 K) whereas velocity is decreased 3.63% (4.171 m/s). The new geometry of the transition piece leads to a diminution of the average turbine inlet temperature (TIT) of about 2.32% (28.29 K) and the average velocity of about 7.73% (4.217 m/s). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."""

The minimum value of the gradient Richardson number in the upper flank of the jet exceeds the critical value of 0.25 for linear shear instability.

Two back to back 2-level pulse width modulated (PWM) voltage source converters are typically used for the FRCs. The two converters are interconnected through the dc link capacitors. The power converters are based on multi-chip IGBT modules. One way of increasing the inherent reliability of the FRC is to reduce the operating electrical and thermal stresses on these IGBT modules. A higher dc link voltage leads to high IGBT stresses. Higher dc link voltage is also a major contributor to cosmic ray induced failures. In the existing FRCs in wind turbine systems, the dc link voltage is maintained at a fixed value while the modulation indices of the two converters are varied.

Above this speed, the generator bridge converter dominates at certain network conditions where its modulation index needs to be at maximum while network bridge modulation index is varied to match the network voltage.

This type of predictions will allow timely actions to be taken in order to cope with the expected values of the target variable on a certain future time horizon. In this paper we study this type of predictions - the prediction of a range of expected values for a future time interval. We describe some possible approaches to this task and propose an alternative procedure that our extensive experiments on both artificial and real world domains show to have clear advantages.

This work presents two alternatives that reduce the sensitivity to experimental errors, capitalizing on recent works where additional degrees of freedom are used to improve the robustness of substructure uncoupling. The system of interest is tested while mounted on a stiff fixture, where some modes of the fixture inevitably interact with those of the system of interest. The modes of the systemfixture assembly are extracted using a modal test and then a modal substructuring approach is used to apply constraints to eliminate the motion of the fixture. Two types of constraints are proposed, one based on the modes of the fixture and the other on a singular value decomposition of the fixture motion that was observed during the test. Neither approach requires an estimate of the displacements or rotations at the points where the system of interest is connected to the fixture. The methods are validated by applying them to experimental measurements from a simple test system meant to mimic a flexible satellite on a stiff shaker table.

The mean wind speed data of three-hour interval long term period from 1997 to 2005 was adopted and analyzed in order to determine the potential of wind power generation.

For that purpose, dynamical downscaling of 10 yr (1992-2001) of the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) was performed to 8-km horizontal grid spacing with the use of a spectral, prognostic full-physics model Aire Limitée Adaptation Dynamique Développement International (ALADIN"	" the """"ALHR"""" version). Then modeled data with a 60-min frequency were refined to 2-km horizontal grid spacing with a simplified and cost-effective model version, the so-called dynamical adaptation (DADA). The statistical verification of ERA-40-, ALHR-, and DADA-modeled wind speed on the basis of data from measurement stations representing different regions of Croatia suggests that downscaling was successful and that model accuracy generally improves as horizontal resolution is increased. The areas of the highest mean wind speeds correspond well to locations of frequent and strong bora flow as well as to the prominent mountain peaks. The best results are achieved with DADA and contain bias of 1% of the mean wind speed for eastern Croatia while reaching 10% for complex coastal terrain, mainly because of underestimation of the strongest winds. Root-mean-square errors for DADA are significantly smaller for flat terrain than for complex terrain, with relative values close to 12% of the mean wind speed regardless of the station location. Spectral analyses suggest that the shape of the kinetic energy spectra generally relaxes from k-3 at the upper troposphere to the shape of orographic spectra near the surface and shows no seasonal variability. Apart from the buildup of energy on smaller scales of motions, it is shown that mesoscale simulations contain a considerable amount of energy related to near-surface and mostly divergent meso-?-scale (20-200 km) motions. Spectral decomposition of measured and modeled data in temporal space indicates a reasonable performance of all model datasets in simulating the primary maximum of spectral power related to synoptic and larger-than-diurnal mesoscale motions, with somewhat increased accuracy of mesoscale model data. The primary improvement of dynamical adaptation was achieved for cross-mountain winds, whereas mixed results were found for along-mountain wind directions. Secondary diurnal and tertiary semidiurnal maxima are significantly better simulated with the mesoscale model for coastal stations but are somewhat more erroneous for the continental station.

The annual installed capacity in the European Union (EU) has risen from 814 MW in 1996 to 10,163 MW in 2009. However, one major drawback of wind energy is the variability in production due to the stochastic nature of wind. Integrating the risk of wind energy uncertainty into profitability assessments is important for investors in wind energy. The article presents statistical simulation methods to incorporate risks from stochastic wind speeds into profitability calculations. We apply the Measure-Correlate-Predict (MCP) Method within the Variance Ratio Method to generate long-term wind velocity estimates for a potential wind energy site in Austria. The bootstrapping method is applied to generate wind velocities for the economic life-time of a wind turbine. The Internal Rate of Return is used as profitability indicator. We use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) approach to derive probability levels for certain internal rate of returns, as the CVaR is a reliable risk measure even if return distributions are not normal. Our approach closes the gap in the scientific literature on statistical simulation methods for the economic evaluation of wind energy sites. In contrast to other scientific publications, our methodology can be generally applied, because we do not rely on estimated distributions for wind speed predictions, but on measured wind speed distributions, which are usually readily available. In addition, the CVaR has not been applied as a measure of risk for wind site evaluation before and it does not rely on any specific function regarding the profitability distribution.

In order to better determine the large-scale 3D-structure of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies we present a Faraday rotation analysis of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 5775. Methods. Deep radio-continuum observations in total power and linear polarization were performed at 8.46 GHz with the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg telescope. They were analyzed together with archival 4.86 and 1.49 GHz VLA-data. We thus can derive rotation measures from a comparison of three frequencies and determine the intrinsic magnetic field structure. Results. A very extended halo is detected in NGC 5775, with magnetic field lines forming an X-shaped structure. Close to the galactic disk the magnetic field is plane-parallel. The scaleheights of the radio emission esimated for NGC 5775 are comaprable with other galaxies. The rotation measure distribution varies smoothly on both sides along the major axis from positive to negative values. Conclusions. From the derived distribution of rotation measures and the plane-parallel intrinsic magnetic field orientation along the galactic midplane we conclude that NGC 5775 has an even axisymmetric large-scale magnetic field configuration in the disk as generated by an ??-dynamo which is accompanied by a quadrupolar poloidal field. The magnetic field lines of the plane-parallel component are pointing outwards. The observed X-shaped halo magnetic field, however, cannot be explained by the action of the disk's mean-field dynamo alone.

Installed on the southeast wall of two broiler barns located 40. km east of Montreal, Canada, the performance of solar air pre-heaters was monitored over 2. years. Sensors inside the barns monitored the temperature of the ambient air, that pre-heated by the solar collector and that exhausted by one of the three operating fans. An on-site weather station measured ambient air temperature, wind direction and velocity and radiation energy absorbed on a vertical plane parallel to the unglazed solar air pre-heaters. The measured vertical solar radiation value was used to evaluate the heat recovery efficiency of the unglazed solar air pre-heaters. Using data from the Varennes Environment Canada weather station located 30. km northwest, the solar sensors were found to measure the absorbed solar radiation with a maximum error of 7%, including differences in exterior air moisture. Unglazed, the efficiency of the solar air pre-heaters reached 65% for wind velocities under 2. m/s, but dropped below 25% for wind velocities exceeding 7. m/s. Nevertheless, the unglazed solar air pre-heaters were able to reduce the heating load especially in March of both years. Over a period starting in November and ending in March, the solar air heaters recovered an energy value equivalent to an annual return on investment of 4.7%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."""

Two different ways of implementing a VAr management system are proposed and analyzed.

Basically, this overrated reactive power capacity is a consequence of sizing wind turbine facilities for maximum active power level. The reactive power losses, due to active power transportation inside the plant (normally two transformers), and P-Q wind turbine characteristics define the P-Q reserve chart.

The flow structure and the escape rate (number flux of molecules escaping the atmosphere) are analyzed for the source Jeans parameter ?0 (ratio of the gravitational energy to thermal energy of the molecules) and Knudsen number Kn0 (ratio of the mean free path to the source radius) ranging from 0 to 15 and from 0.0001 to ?, respectively.

In this research effort, ultrasonic actuator disks excite isotropic plates and airfoil-shaped structures that are representative of helicopter leading-edge protection-cap shapes. Off-the-shelf ultrasonic actuators are used to create ice-interface shear stresses sufficient to promote instantaneous ice delamination of thin layers of impact ice (less than 3 mm thick). A steel plate of 30:48 cm × 30:48 cm × 1 mm was actuated by three lead zirconate titanate disks excited at their ultrasonic radial mode. The ultrasonic vibration introduced transverse shear stresses that prevented ice formation on top of the actuator locations for a fraction of the power required with electrothermal systems used in helicopter rotor blades (0:18 W=cm2 vs 3:8 W=cm2). Experiments also showed ice delamination in areas of the plates where transverse shear stresses were concentrated. As ice thicknesses reached a critical value of approximately 1.2 mm, ice debonded from those steel-plate areas. A model of the three disk actuated steel plate was created and correlated with experimental results observed during impact-icing test experiments. Both, the predicted ultrasonic modes of the system and the ice-shedding areas agreed with experimental results.

The dip to a minimum value for the wake velocity values occurs because the relative power input is decreasing as the free-stream velocity ration va increases. Eventually, as va continues to increase (or relative power decreases) the wake velocity vo must asymptotically approach the free-stream value va for all values of blockage.

We wished to analyse a sample of observations from the XMM-Newton Science Archive to search for evidence of exospheric solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) emission. Methods. We analysed 3012 observations up to and including revolution 1773. The method employed extends from that of the previously published paper by these authors on this topic. We detect temporal variability in the diffuse X-ray background within a narrow low-energy band and contrast this to a continuum. The low-energy band was chosen to represent the key indicators of charge exchange emission and the continuum was expected to be free of SWCX. Results. Approximately 3.4% of observations studied are affected. We discuss our results with reference to the XMM-Newton mission. We further investigate remarkable cases by considering the state of the solar wind and the orientation of XMM-Newton at the time of these observations. We present a method to approximate the expected emission from observations, based on given solar wind parameters taken from an upstream solar wind monitor. We also compare the incidence of SWCX cases with solar activity. Conclusions. We present a comprehensive study of the majority of the suitable and publically available XMM-Newton Science Archive to date, with respect to the occurrence of SWCX enhancements. We present our SWCX-affected subset of this dataset. The mean exospheric-SWCX flux observed within this SWCX-affected subset was 15.4 keV cm-2 s-1 sr-1 in the energy band 0.25 to 2.5 keV.

In this paper, we estimate the value to the maritime shipping industry of ocean surface wind information and of wind and wave condition forecasts based on this information. Commercial ships transiting the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans are exposed to severe wind and wave conditions associated with extratropical storms. These storms impose costs on maritime commerce by delaying and sometimes damaging vessels or causing loss of cargo. Ocean surface wind information allows ships to limit their exposure to these conditions. We estimate that average expected annual losses to container shipping (lost containers and associated damage to vessels) in the absence of good information about extratropical storm conditions would be on the order of $250 million/year in the North Pacific and $120 million/year in the North Atlantic, and we estimate average expected annual losses to bulk shipping operations from extratropical storm exposure in these regions to be on the order of $150 million/year. A significant fraction of this risk can be avoided with ocean surface vector wind observations and forecasts. Our model results suggest that the QuikSCAT information (available until November 2009) and associated forecasts enabled a reduction in annual exposure for shipping traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific of about 50%, with total annual net savings around $150 million.

Event 1 had an associated storm initial phase with peak Dst=+9nT. This was caused by a high plasma density heliospheric plasma sheet (HPS) which impacted the magnetosphere. The southward component of IMF Bz fluctuations in the corotating interaction regions (CIRs) of both Events 1 and 2 led to peak storm main phases of Dst=-85 and -62nT, respectively. The extended storm """"recovery"""" phases were associated with ?B/Bo ~1-2 Alfvénic fluctuations in the HSS proper. High-intensity, long-duration, continuous AE (HILDCAA) intervals were present, presumably due to the southward component of the Alfvén waves.

The IMF Bz-AE cross-correlation (c.c.) coefficients during the storm main phase of Event 1 and for 24-h of the HSS of Event 2 give similar results. For the Event 1, a peak c.c. of -0.4 occurred with a lag of 103min, and for Event 2 a peak c.c of -0.38 with a lag of 67min was obtained. Both c.c. results were sharply peaked. The decay-portion of a HSS prior to Event 1 was characterized by low Np, low Bo and low Alfvén wave amplitudes. The 1-h IMF ?z2 and ?2 z/B2 o were 0.84nT2 and 2.9×10-2, respectively.

Momentum fluxes in the stratosphere are derived for both instruments and for SABER in the whole mesosphere. The large-scale atmospheric background state is removed by a two-dimensional Fourier decomposition in longitude and time, covering even planetary-scale waves with periods as short as 1-2 days. Therefore, it is possible to provide global distributions of GW momentum flux from observations for the first time in the mesosphere. Seasonal as well as longer-term variations of the global momentum flux distribution are discussed. GWs likely contribute significantly to the equatorward tilt of the polar night jet and to the poleward tilt of the summertime mesospheric jet. Our results suggest that GWs can undergo large latitudinal shifts while propagating upward. In particular, GWs generated by deep convection in the subtropical monsoon regions probably contribute significantly to the mesospheric summertime wind reversal at mid- and high latitudes. Variations in the GW longitudinal distribution caused by those convectively generated GWs are still observed in the mesosphere and could be important for the generation of the quasi two-day wave. Indications for quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) induced variations of GW momentum flux are found in the subtropics.

Growing interest in unmanned air vehicles that can hover or """"perch and stare"""" has motivated further investigation of this aerodynamic configuration. Analysis of wind tunnel data for an axisymmetric generic ducted fan configuration has led to a new compact non-dimensional modeling scheme. This new approach captures the nonlinear characteristics of the force and moment data while representing these terms in a set of simple equations. Force coefficients based on fan rotational speed are plotted versus advance ratio for a range of angles of attack, yielding several observations. Each angle of attack yields a linear trend as a function of advance ratio but with differing slopes, with all lines converging through a single point. This fulcrum point shares the same thrust coefficient value as static/hover tests, but at a non-zero advance ratio value. This suggests that a hovering ducted fan self-induces an advance ratio, even though the vehicle is stationary. The complicated pitching moment behavior is captured succinctly through modeling the center of pressure movement as a function of advance ratio and angle of attack. Fan power required was also successfully modeled using Figure of Merit, typically a hover performance metric, over the entire flight regime to relate power required to thrust generated. The new modeling technique attains very high correlation values, and is possibly the most compact representation of ducted fan aerodynamics to date, using only twelve non-dimensional coefficients.

Large scale usage of wind energy can significantly reduce the pollutions and carbon emission otherwise caused by fossil fuel.

One difficulty of integrating large scale wind power is related to the uncertainty in wind power. Unlike hydro energy which is also renewable and intermittent, wind power output is hard to predict precisely due to the indeterminacy in wind speed. The uncertainty not only causes difficulty in scheduling, but also system stability and security concerns in operation.

It is noted that firm conclusions cannot be reached without adequate modelling of available power. Whilst this would normally require many years of experience of wind farm operation across a wide geographical area, in Britain such data are currently unavailable. However, more extensive coverage via national meteorological centre data may be available to facilitate a synthesis of future patterns of available wind power. These can be used by a transmission planner to assess the distribution of possible flows across main transmission boundaries. To be useful, the approach must respect the correlations of available wind power at different locations on the system. Furthermore, trends in wind speed through a day and through a year must be reliably reproduced captured so that the relationship to annual and diurnal load variations can subsequently be studied. A wind synthesis methodology is described. By being based on many years of wind speed data it permits the estimation of long-term risks associated with more extreme wind conditions. After dealing with gaps in the original wind speed dataset, a vector autoregression (VAR) approach is used to model wind speeds. Wind speeds generated by the model are converted to those that may be observed at 'typical' wind farm locations at 10m above ground level for different terrain types in different zones and then converted to hub height. The 'per unit' available wind power is then calculated by use of a wind speed to power curve. After having specified the total wind generation capacity in each terrain in each zone for the scenario they wish to study, the user of the tool is then able to calculate the total available power. When combined with scenarios describing load demand and the availability and dispatch of conventional generation, future capacity margins and power flows can be studied, e.g. for identification of future system reinforcement requirements. An extension of the approach is presented that permits study of available power and power flows through a year of operation. This also uses vector autoregression (VAR) to model wind speeds but is applied after a careful detrending process to allow diurnal and seasonal effects to be correctly treated. Finally, future developments of the approach are outlined and it is suggested that the same approach may be useful not only in power system planning but also in support of power system operation."""

Since the arrangement, density, shape and orientation of buildings in an urban area can hinder the wind stream by acting like wind breaks, problems with stagnant wind conditions caused by such buildings need to be examined in terms of both indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, people's activities inevitably generate heat, contaminants, and so on. These waste contaminants are often discharged indoors initially, within buildings, and then exhausted to the outside by means of the ventilation system connecting both the outside and inside environment. The urban wind flow between densely packed buildings may be weakened and less able to dilute or transport these waste contaminants away, resulting in higher concentrations of contaminants both inside and outside the buildings. The wind environment is a stochastic phenomenon. To deal with this stochastic feature, this study introduces the use of exceedance probability analysis to evaluate the extreme wind properties rather than the mean values. In addition, since the wind environment can be evaluated in terms of both ventilation performance and thermal comfort, two representative indices were adopted: the local purging flow rate (LPRF), and the space-averaged kinetic energy of wind (KEW). The former was used to express the ability of airflow to exhaust contaminants generated within a given space, and the latter was used to represent the ability of airflows to cool the human body. The local air change rate (N) per volume of void space (V P) was defined and used as the ventilation index, based on the local purging flow rate (LPFR). The exceedance probability (EP) was calculated based on the wind speed distributions described by the Weibull function for 16 azimuths. This was then used to indicate the exceedance probability of a given air change rate, assuming a linear correlation between the velocity at the reference point and the calculated local air change rate. The exceedance probability of the kinetic energy (KE) of wind in the void space was also evaluated in the same way as the local air change rate.

Many modeling and experimental research activities are carried out in order to continuously improve devices performance. Another promising sector is small scale turbines, below 100kW installed power, for small installation, domestic use, and to be installed on ships. Moving within this scenario, a 1,5 kW turbine was tested inside a wind tunnel, and the following were measured: forces applied to the tower, angular speed, electric power output, mechanical power involved, and stress induced on the blades. Moreover, the cut in rotor speed and the turbine's efficiency came as outputs of the activity. After some simple forecast calculations, to establish expected maximum values of physical quantities, the experiment was designed. The method used for acquiring all the values at one time involves a wi-fi device, attached to the rotor, in order to acquire signals coming from strain-gauges placed on the blades, avoiding long and cumbersome transmission lines towards the DAQ, coupled to anemometers, load cells, and a wattmeter. Coordination of operators during the tests had a crucial role in carrying out the procedure correctly. Since the main objects of study were blades, rotor and electric generator, the tower has been replaced with a robust support structure, designed to host and protect load cells and signal conditioners from accidental damage, thus permitting a correct measurement of axial force applied to the rotor and reacting momentum of the generator. The wi-fi device was linked to the rotor, in order to affect its mass and inertia characteristics as less as possible. This required the design of a proper linking structure, which was light and well balanced despite being mechanically resistant. Measured quantities are useful to evaluate the turbine's performance (efficiency, power curve, cut in speed), and also to validate some fem and multi physics predictive models, that are currently under development, as possible tools for general wind turbines design. The outputs of these tests satisfy the need for a wide range of experimental data. This way of designing tests, the physical quantities involved and the schedule of experiments can be suggested as a valuable operative procedure. © 2010 by ASME."""

It is important to understand exactly how atmospheric variables affect remote sensor performance. Some researchers have proposed that atmospheric absorption of sound is a significant limiting factor in SODAR performance. The atmospheric absorption coefficient (?, dB/m) is dependent on N2 and O2 molecule excitation modes, which are functions of temperature (T), pressure (P), humidity (RH), and acoustic frequency (f). Second Wind's Triton Sonic Profiler® is a mono-static, phased array SODAR. It is deployed at over 150 locations worldwide in a variety of conditions. The Triton collects atmospheric data as well as wind data, and it adjusts its transmit frequency based on temperature (the speed of sound varies with T). From meteorological data at 89 Triton locations (47 years equivalent), it was found that typical ? are between 0.03 dB/m and 0.06 dB/m, and only 2.6% of measurements exceeded 0.09 dB/m. 62 sites had ? &gt"	 0.09 dB/m less than 1% of the time	 20 had ? &gt	 0.09 dB/m between 1% and 5% of the time	 and 7 sites had ? &gt	 0.09 dB/m between 5% and 15% of the time. There was wide seasonal variability for the fleet as a whole, with winter having the highest average absorption, and summer the lowest. All of the Tritons that recorded ? &gt	 0.09 dB/m more than 3% of the time were located in the high desert of the western United States. To illustrate a relationship between ? and 120 m signal-to-noise ratio, only midday data was used, those times with solar declination angle greater than 20. This data set is most likely to have an unstable atmosphere, ideal for SODAR performance. For the aggregated data set, absorption and 120 m SNR showed a clear correlation, the median value decreasing from 16.2 for ? ~ 0.03 dB/m, to 12.4 for ? ~ 0.065 dB/m, to 9.37 for ? &gt	 0.0937. High quality data recovery mirrored this decay, but even for ? &gt	" 0.0937, the data recovery rate was 62.2%, higher than expected. Furthermore, the data recovery rate and SNR seem to level off above 0.07 dB/m, implying that the arid conditions that give rise to high absorption might also have some positive effects on SODAR performance that mitigate further signal decay. Overall, atmospheric absorption coefficients stay in a relatively benign range, and do not seem to be a primary driver of data loss for the Triton. Those sites that do experience high absorption coefficients clearly show an attenuation of the Triton signal, but do not degrade it overwhelmingly. In tandem with other atmospheric effects the data loss could be greater, especially in neutral atmospheres."""

A new method is proposed in this paper to remove the strong wind effect by adding deflecting plates under the air-cooled platform, which contributes to forming a uniform air mass flow rate in the axial fans by leading enough cooling air to the fans in the upwind region.

As the notion of energy saving and environmental protection gradually finds its way deep into people's heart, the issue of energy efficient design and operation of the vessels has attracted more and more attentions. How to make the vessels maintain service speed while consuming less fuel has quickly become the main concern of the naval architects. In this paper, we present a new procedure to predict speed reduction and fuel consumption of a ship at actual seas. The prediction takes into account the added resistance due to waves since it is recognized to be the predominant component, while wind resistance, fouling effect and other resistance components are relatively small and temporarily ignored. The calculation of the added resistance is based on a three-dimensional frequencydomain panel method for regular waves and spectral approach is applied to obtain the mean value. Then speed prediction is performed based on a simplified model assuming the balanced working point among the ship, propeller and the engine under the assumption of linear relationship between the engine torque and its rotation. Fuel consumption prediction is carried out through calculating the engine power, the effective fuel consumption rate and the time for sailing. Long-term prediction is made through combining the short-term result with the longterm ocean wave statistics from the Database of Winds and Waves which is newly developed in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). A long-term probability model which takes into account the ship's actual navigation conditions is applied, and the expected ship speed and fuel consumption along her actual sea route are predicted accordingly. For the purposed of practical use, a VLCC ship type is adopted for the prediction as an example. Finally, it has been concluded that the propulsive performance, i.e. speed and fuel consumption, of the vessel at actual seas can be improved through design considerations such as hull form optimization, engine selection and weather routing.

Implicit and explicit method are both incorporated for the time integration in the dynamic analysis. Since the accident down burst gust have not been detailedly observed, the strong wind model and the simple gust model are experientially specified as the load boundary condition. The calculation results show that, maximum stress values of some tower members exceeds design values under the specified strong wind and then may overload tower members. With the specified downburst load, tower collapses will occur, and the broken-down tower in the simulation is very similar with real one.

The standard TLD configuration is where a TLD is connected rigidly to the top of the building. It has been popular as a control device for wind excitation. Earlier research has shown that the TLD behaviour is amplitude dependent, i.e. it is more effective when excitation amplitude is increased and more energy is dissipated due to sloshing. A modified TLD configuration is proposed here, where the TLD rests on an elevated platform that is connected to the top of the building through a rigid rod with a flexible rotational spring at its bottom. For particular values of the rotational spring flexibility, the rotational acceleration of the rod is in phase with the structure top acceleration and the TLD base is subjected to a large amplitude acceleration that increases its effectiveness. It should be noted that when the rotational spring is rigid, the modified and standard TLD configurations are identical. It is seen that, for aiven structure with modified TLD configuration, there exists an optimum value of the rotational spring stiffness for which the effectiveness of the modified TLD is maximum.

Carinae exhibits soft X-ray thermal emission that varies strongly around the periastron passage. It has been found to have non-thermal emission, thanks to its detection in hard X-rays using INTEGRAL and Suzaku, and also in ?-rays with AGILE and Fermi. Aims. This paper attempts to definitively identify ? Carinae as the source of the hard X-ray emission, to examine how changes in the 2-10 keV band influence changes in the hard X-ray band, and to understand more clearly the mechanisms producing the non-thermal emission using new INTEGRAL observations obtained close to periastron passage. Methods. To strengthen the identification of ? Carinae with the hard X-ray source, a long Chandra observation encompassing the INTEGRAL/ISGRI error circle was analysed, and all other soft X-ray sources (including the outer shell of ? Carinae itself) were discarded as likely counter-parts. To expand the knowledge of the physical processes governing the X-ray lightcurve, new hard X-ray images of ? Carinae were studied close to periastron, and compared to previous observations far from periastron. Results. The INTEGRAL component, when represented by a power law (with a photon index ? of 1.8), would produce more emission in the Chandra band than observed from any point source in the ISGRI error circle apart from ? Carinae, as long as the hydrogen column density to the ISGRI source is lower than N H ? 1024 cm-2. Sources with such a high absorption are very rare, thus the hard X-ray emission is very likely to be associated with ? Carinae. The eventual contribution of the outer shell to the non-thermal component also remains fairly limited. Close to periastron passage, a 3-? detection is achieved for the hard X-ray emission of ? Carinae, with a flux similar to the average value far from periastron. Conclusions. Assuming a single absorption component for both the thermal and non-thermal sources, this 3-? detection can be explained with a hydrogen column density that does not exceed NH ? 6 × 10 23 cm-2 without resorting to an intrinsic increase in the hard X-ray emission. The energy injected in hard X-rays (averaged over a month timescale) appears to be rather constant at least as close as a few stellar radii, well within the acceleration region of the wind. © 2010 ESO."""

The standard theory is based on an early field generation by Biermann battery effects, possibly at the epoch of reionisation, followed by a long period of field amplification by galactic dynamos. The origin and the magnitude of the inter-galactic magnetic field is of primordial importance in this global picture, as it is considered to be the missing link between galactic magnetic fields and cluster magnetic fields on much larger scales. Aims: We are testing whether dwarf galaxies are good candidates to explain the enrichment of the Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM): after their discs form and trigger galactic dynamos, supernova feedback will launch strong winds, expelling magnetic field lines in the IGM. Methods: We have performed magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy, which forms self-consistently inside a cooling halo. Using the RAMSES code, we simulated for the first time the formation of a magnetised supernova-driven galactic outflow. This simulation is an important step towards a more realistic modelling using fully cosmological simulations. Results: Our simulations reproduce well the observed properties of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies. The formation and the evolution of our simulated disc leads to a strong magnetic field amplification: the magnetic field in the final wind bubble is one order of magnitude larger than the initial value. The magnetic field in the disc, essentially toroidal, is growing linearly with time as a consequence of differential rotation. Conclusions: We discuss the consequence of this simple mechanism on the cosmic evolution of the magnetic field: we propose a new scenario for the evolution of the magnetic field, with dwarf galaxies playing a key role in amplifying and ejecting magnetic energy in the IGM, resulting in what we call a """"cosmic dynamo"""" that could contribute to the very high field strengths observed in galaxies and clusters today. © ESO 2010."""

Main goal is to incorporate the prioritization criteria for the assessment of various energy policies for power alternatives, and evaluating these policies against these criteria. The three types of EPPs reviewed in this study are: electricity production from wind farms in the future, existing coal-based thermal power plants and planned nuclear power plants. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to assess the main and sub-factors of EPPs. Main factors such as economic, technical, social and environmental are assigned in first level of the AHP. The importance weights of factors are produced and priority values with realistic numbers are obtained using Fuzzy-AHP Chang's Model. Priority value for wind energy was determined as two times higher than the others when making the ultimate decision. On aggregate, importance weights of environmental (0.68) and social (0.69) factors make wind power leader. Sub-factors such as public acceptance, waste-emission and environmental impacts cause both nuclear and thermal power to have the lowest priority numbers. Additionally, the CO2 emissions trade was determined to be a very important criterion associated with both economic and environmental factors according to Kyoto Protocol.

The objective of this study was to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) from canopy temperature and energy balance measurements and evaluate the utility of CWSI to quantify water stress by comparing CWSI to latent heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements over canopies of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.). The experiment was conducted at the Yucheng Integrated Agricultural Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2003 to 2005. Latent heat and CO2 fluxes (by eddy covariance), canopy and air temperature, relative humidity, net radiation, wind speed, and soil heat flux were averaged at half-hour intervals. Leaf area index and crop height were measured every 7 days. CWSI was calculated from measured canopy-air temperature differences using the Jackson method. Under high net radiation conditions (greater than 500 W m-2), calculated values of minimum canopy-air temperature differences were similar to previously published empirically determined non-water-stressed baselines. Valid measures of CWSI were only obtained when canopy closure minimized the influence of viewed soil on infrared canopy temperature measurements (leaf area index was greater than 2.5 m2 m-2). Wheat and maize latent heat flux and canopy CO2 flux generally decreased linearly with increases in CWSI when net radiation levels were greater than 300 W m-2. The responses of latent heat flux and CO2 flux to CWSI did not demonstrate a consistent relationship in wheat that would recommend it as a reliable water stress quantification tool. The responses of latent heat flux and CO2 flux to CWSI were more consistent in maize, suggesting that CWSI could be useful in identifying and quantifying water stress conditions when net radiation was greater than 300 W m-2.

The generally large aerosol load in the Santiago atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) facilitates the use of these backscatter profiles for the retrieval of the daytime mixed layer height (MH), especially around midday. In winter mornings, however, MH retrievals are frequently confused by upper residual aerosol layers, while in summer afternoons very low aerosol concentrations often preclude them. Based on a database formed with successful MH retrievals over Santiago, the hourly, synoptic, and seasonal variability of clear-day MHs are documented. Daytime growth rates of MH show typical values of 50 mh-1 in winter and 100 mh-1 in summer. MHs at 1200 LT (UTC - 4 h) present a fourfold change between the cold months (MH ~200 m) and the warm months (MH ~800 m). Interquartile ranges of the monthly distributions of MH are about 200 m, with little change along the seasons. This statistical description of MH data is supplemented with analysis of temperature, solar radiation, and wind data at selected stations located at the basin's floor, at the basin's entrance, and at an elevated location representative of a level about 400 m above the basin's floor. Seasonal MH variability appears highly controlled by the surface energy budget, with about 30% of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative energy being used in the warming and growth of the daytime MH. Advection of cool air from the marine boundary layer to the west of the basin also appears to be important in the basin's ABL energy budget in some cases. Stability of the early morning temperature profile in the basin's air mass is also a factor in the mixed layer growth. Under conditions of large bulk stability of the basin's air mass, there exist cases of very shallow daytime mixed layers that appear to develop after nights in which the stability is highly enhanced near the surface.

A deterministic net radiation model was developed using hemispherical canopy images coupled with on-site microclimate measurements. Modelled net radiation agreed reasonably with measured net radiation. Air temperature and humidity measured at two locations above the stream, separated by 900 m, were generally similar, whereas wind speed was poorly correlated between the two sites. Modelled net radiation varied considerably along the reach, and measurements at a single location did not provide a reliable estimate of the modelled reach average. During summer, net radiation dominated the surface heat exchanges, particularly because the sensible and latent heat fluxes were normally of opposite sign and thus tended to cancel each other. All surface heat fluxes shifted to negative values in autumn and were of similar magnitude through winter. In March, net radiation became positive, but heat gains were cancelled by sensible and latent heat fluxes, which remained negative. A modelling exercise using three canopy cover scenarios (current, simulated prewildfire and simulated complete vegetation removal) showed that net radiation under the standing dead trees was double that modelled for the pre-fire canopy cover. However, post-disturbance standing dead trees reduce daytime net radiation reaching the stream surface by one-third compared with complete vegetation removal.

Two sets of Eta model forecasts are made: one with a coarse resolution of 22 km, and another with a nested grid of 3.5 km, centered on the Nasudden power plants, (18.22°E, 57.07°N"	 3 m) at island Gotland, Sweden.

Aims. We investigate the impact of using different inputs (gas density and hydrogen fraction in the Galactic disc, source spectral shape, low-energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, and nuclear fragmentation cross-sections) on the best-fit values of the transport parameters. We quantify the systematics produced when varying these inputs, and compare them to statistical uncertainties. We discuss the consequences for the slope of the diffusion coefficient ?. Methods. The analysis relies on the propagation code USINE interfaced with the Minuit minimisation routines. Results. We find the typical systematic uncertainties to be greater than the statistical ones. The several published values of ? (from 0.3 to 0.8) can be recovered when varying the low-energy shape of the diffusion coefficient and the convective wind strength. Models including a convective wind are characterised by ? ? 0.6, which cannot be reconciled with the expected theoretical values (1/3 and 1/2). However, from a statistical point of view (?2 analysis), models with both reacceleration and convection-hence large ?-are favoured. The next favoured models in line yield ?, which can be accommodated with 1/3 and 1/2, but require a strong upturn of the diffusion coefficient at low energy (and no convection). Conclusions. To date, using the best statistical tools, the transport parameter determination is still plagued by many unknowns at low energy (?GeV/n).

They are also ubiquitous elements of models of remote astrophysical objects like the interacting stellar winds in binary stellar systems. Studying stability of such flows is paramount for understanding physical processes in space. The simplest shear flow is a tangential magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) discontinuity. We start our review from considering the instability of tangential MHD discontinuity (called the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability) first in incompressible plasmas, and then taking the compressibility into account. We introduce the notion of the absolute and convective instabilities. The physical behaviour of absolutely unstable flows is qualitatively different from that of convectively unstable flows. Studying the absolute and convective instabilities is based on the analysis of asymptotic behaviour (for large time) of the solution of the initial value problem. The initial value problem for a tangential discontinuity is ill-posed: the instability increment is unbounded. This implies that the absolute and convective instabilities of tangential discontinuities cannot be studied. To obtain a well-posed problem we have either to take dissipation into account, or to consider a continuous velocity profile. In both cases we obtain a surprising result: the account of either of these two effects decreases the threshold value of the velocity jump needed for instability. This phenomenon is related to negative energy waves. We show that, in both cases, the instability is the so-called negative energy instability rather than the KH instability. Finally we consider two examples of the theory application: the heliopause stability and the stability of the Earth's magnetopause. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd."""

The analyses are performed by using hourly measurements of air temperature (T), web-bulb temperature (Tw), surface atmospheric pressure (P), wind velocity and direction, rainfall and thunder and lightning observations collected at the Meteorological Station of the University of São Paulo in conjunction with aerosol measurements obtained by AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network), and the NCEP-DOE (National Centers for Environmental Prediction Department of Energy) reanalysis and radiosondes.

For the NTDs, the wind is well characterized by the sea-breeze circulation that in the morning has the wind blowing from the northeast and in the afternoon from the southeast. The TDs show that the air temperature diurnal cycle presents higher amplitude and the maximum temperature of the day is 3.2°C higher than in NTDs. Another important factor found is the difference between moisture that is higher during TDs. In terms of precipitation, the TDs represent 40% of total of days analyzed and those days are responsible for more than 60% of the total rain accumulation during the summer, for instance 50% of the TDs had more than 15.5mmday -1 while the NTDs had 4mmday -1.

In terms of pollution, this study employed the AERONET data to obtain the main aerosol characteristics in the atmospheric column for both TDs and NTDs. The particle size distribution and particle volume size distribution have similar concentrations for both TDs and NTDs and present a similar fine and coarse mode mean radius. In respect to the atmospheric loading, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at different frequencies presented closed mean values for both TDs and NTDs that were statistically significant at 95% level. The spectral dependency of those values in conjunction with the Angstrom parameter reveal the higher concentration of the fine mode particles that are more likely to be hygroscopic and from urban areas.

This paper aims to delineate the cumulative geographic extent of impact by investigating the spatial distribution of mercury and other trace elements of environmental concern in nine freshwater lakes, which cover the large area surrounding the coal-fired power plants in central Alberta, Canada. 210-Lead dating was used in conjunction with physical evidence of deposited fly ash to determine the sediments' age and hence the depths corresponding to the onset of coal-fired power generation in 1956. Total mean concentrations and fluxes of elements of environmental concern with integrated values since 1956 were then determined. The concentration values do not reflect the catastrophic oil spill at Lake Wabamun in 2005. The post-1956 flux rates of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, V, W, and Zn were generally highest in sediment cores obtained from two lakes adjacent to power plants. However, the variable prevailing wind directions played an important role in determining the aerial distribution of Hg and other trace elements to the southeast and to the west of the power plants. Post-1956 fluxes of most elements declined downwind (westward), consistent with strong easterly winds transporting metal pollution further to the west of the power plants. However, spatial interpolation of the data suggested a major southern extension to the area of maximum metal deposition, which has not been sampled by this or previous studies in the region. An atmospheric model estimate of total Hg flux in 2007 near the Genesee power plant was substantially lower than indicated by the most impacted lake sediments, which have integrated Hg fluxes since 1956.

Many of the currently used approaches to extreme response predictions are based on the asymptotic generalized extreme value distribution, whose parameters are estimated from the observed data. However, in most practical situations, it is not easy to ascertain whether the given response time series contain data above a high level that are truly asymptotic, and hence the obtained parameter values by the adopted estimation methods, which points to the appropriate extreme value distribution, may become inconsequential. In this paper, the extreme value statistics are predicted taking advantage of the regularity of the tail region of the mean upcrossing rate function. This method is instrumental in handling combined uncertainties associated with nonergodic processes (system uncertainties) as well as ergodic ones (stochastic loading). For the specific applications considered, it can be assumed that the considered time series has an extreme value distribution that has the Gumbel distribution as its asymptotic limit. The present method is numerically illustrated through applications to a beam with spatially varying random properties and wind turbines subjected to stochastic loading. © 2010 ASCE."""

The number of large wind power schemes that have failed is growing. The case analysed here is a near-shore wind farm in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea, in 2001 the largest wind project (278 MW) ever proposed in the Netherlands. The government refused to negotiate with civil society organizations representing various landscape values, primarily with the WaddenVereniging and its allies. The often suggested idea that siting wind farms offshore could solve the problems encountered onshore is naïve and far too simple. Siting issues offshore are just as relevant as onshore, as this case study illustrates. As most current offshore developments, the case concerns a near-shore development. It would have been highly visible in an iconic landscape. In such cases, the main dialogue is similar to onshore schemes, which is about impact on the landscape, or 'seascape', as perceived by the public.

The acceptability and the assessment of different qualities in relation to wind farm siting are analysed with a survey among members of the WaddenVereniging, the national environmental organization for the protection of the Wadden region. The analysis reveals that these environmentalists with their strong identification with the landscape, believe that there are suitable sites for wind turbines in this sensitive area. However, the spatial layout that was chosen by the developers was based on a landscape assessment of the governmental architect.

This paper reviews measurements of damping on tall buildings and compares them with values in common usage.

In particular, when the Magnus force was incorporated, the calculated sand transport fluxes and sand transport rate per unit width were closer to the experimental value than when this force was excluded. The sand transport flux is enhanced because the Magnus force owing to particle rotation causes the particles to have higher and longer trajectories, so the particles can get more speed and energy from the wind, which leads to a larger sand transport flux. In addition, it was found that when taking the Magnus force into account, the probability density of the impact velocity and angular velocity of saltating sand grains followed an exponential distribution and a unimodal asymmetric distribution, respectively.

Thus mankind has to rely on the alternate/renewable energy sources like biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, etc. On the other hand, suitable waste management strategy is another important aspect of sustainable development. The growth of welfare levels in modern society during the past decades has brought about a huge increase in the production of all kinds of commodities, which indirectly generate waste. Plastics have been one of the materials with the fastest growth because of their wide range of applications due to versatility and relatively low cost. Since the duration of life of plastic products is relatively small, there is a vast plastics waste stream that reaches each year to the final recipients creating a serious environmental problem. Again, because disposal of post consumer plastics is increasingly being constrained by legislation and escalating costs, there is considerable demand for alternatives to disposal or land filling. Advanced research in the field of green chemistry could yield biodegradable/green polymers but is too limited at this point of time to substitute the non-biodegradable plastics in different applications. Once standards are developed for degradable plastics they can be used to evaluate the specific formulations of materials which will find best application in this state as regards their performance and use characteristics. Among the alternatives available are source reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of the inherent energy value through waste-to-energy incineration and processed fuel applications. Production of liquid fuel would be a better alternative as the calorific value of the plastics is comparable to that of fuels, around 40 MJ/kg. Each of these options potentially reduces waste and conserves natural resources. Plastics recycling, continues to progress with a wide range of old and new technologies. Many research projects have been undertaken on chemical recycling of waste plastics to fuel and monomer. This is also reflected by a number of pilot, demonstration, and commercial plants processing various types of plastic wastes in Germany, Japan, USA, India, and elsewhere.

The geostrophic mesoscale flow shifts the frequency of NIOs by approximately half its vorticity. Equatorward of 30N and S, this effect is added to a global pattern of blue shift of NIOs.

Because the Laplacian of vorticity and vorticity are anticorrelated in the altimeter data set, overall, more near-inertial variance is found in anticyclonic vorticity regions than in cyclonic regions. While this is compatible with anticyclones trapping NIOs, the organization of near-inertial variance by the Laplacian of vorticity is also in very good agreement with previous theoretical and numerical predictions. The inverse bandwidth is a decreasing function of the gradient of vorticity, which acts like the gradient of planetary vorticity to increase the decay of NIOs from the ocean surface. Because the altimetry data set captures the largest vorticity gradients in energetic mesoscale regions, it is also observed that NIOs decay faster in large geostrophic eddy kinetic energy regions.

The phenolic group is either a salicylic acid (o-hydroxybenzoic acid, SA) or an o-hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (PA), where the former gives a resonance-assisted hydrogen bond. Transient absorption data allowed direct determination of the rate constant for these intramolecular, bidirectional, and concerted PCET (CEP) reactions, as a function of temperature and H/D isotope. We found, unexpectedly, that the hydrogen bond in SA is in fact weaker than the hydrogen bond in the complex with PA, which forced us to reassess an earlier hypothesis that the proton coupling term for CEP with SA is increased by a stronger hydrogen bond. Consequently, the kinetic data was modeled numerically using a quantum mechanical rate expression. Sufficient experimentally determined observables were available to give robust and well-determined parameter values. This analysis, coupled with DFT/B3LYP and MP2 calculations and MD simulations, gave a detailed insight into the parameters that control the CEP reactions, and the effect of internal hydrogen bonds. We observed that a model with a static proton-tunneling distance is unable to describe the reaction correctly, requiring unrealistic values for the equilibrium proton-tunneling distances. Instead, when promoting vibrations that modulate the proton donor-acceptor distance were included, satisfactory fits to the experimental data were obtained, with parameter values that agree with DFT calculations and MD simulations. According to these results, it is in fact the weaker hydrogen bond of SA which increases the proton coupling. The inner reorganization energy of the phenolic groups is a significant factor contributing to the CEP barriers, but this is reduced by the hydrogen bonds to 0.35 and 0.50 eV for the two complexes. The promoting vibrations increase the rate of CEP by over 2 orders of magnitude, and dramatically reduce the kinetic isotope effect from ca. 40 for the static case to a modest value of 2-3. © 2009 American Chemical Society."""

The two ways are time-period-based and risk-based approaches. The time-period-based approach defines the availability of wind power during a peak load period with a certain probability that is based on wind power generation statistics. The risk-based approach utilizes the loss of load probability (LOLP). In addition, the two approaches are used to define the capacity credit of wind power in Finland. The results show that the capacity credit in Finland would be 6% of the installed wind power capacity with the timeperiod- based method and 10% with the risk-based method respectively. Finally, different meanings of the concept capacity credit in different contexts are discussed and new terms for capacity credit are suggested in order to avoid confusion of concepts. The advantages of the time-period-based approach are its direct implementation and the fact that it takes into account the variability and unavailability of wind power without complex reliability models. In addition, the time-period-based approach can give the availability of different types of generation independently of other production forms and it suits well to Nordel's way to estimate the power balance. The estimation of capacity credit is based on simultaneously measured wind generation and load data. The risk-based approach gives the added value of wind power capacity to the power system. It considers the reliability of all generation concepts and is a widely used approach. There are though some disadvantages: it requires lot of information about the power system in question and power system simulations are needed. Finally, the capacity credit of wind power calculated by risk-based method cannot directly be applied for power balance studies made in the Nordel, because the Nordic definition of capacity credit for other generation types is based on the different approach. The concept """"capacity credit"""" is used at least in two different ways: 1) it is the available wind power generation during the peak load period, which is not dependent on the power system it is connected to and 2) it is the value of additional wind power capacity on power system in terms of power system security, which is system dependent. Both definitions are correct. They are calculated with different methods and are often used in different contexts, which can create confusion.

A validation of MFwWF is presented on basis of velocities measured downstream of the Horns Rev and the Nysted wind farms. The calculated decrease of the relative velocity deficit with increasing distance downstream a wind farm is supported by measured data from both wind farms. As to the calculated decrease of this deficit with increasing upstream velocity the measured data is inconclusive. Quantitative conclusions have not been drawn because the calculations and the measurements are evaluated in different spanwise positions. In a qualitative sense the calculated relative velocity deficits are in agreement with the measured ones. Resolved profiles show how most of the velocity change occurs in the lower part of the boundary layer whereas most of the wind direction change occurs in the upper part, and that the thinner the boundary layer or the larger the surface roughness, the larger the wind direction change. Near a 5 MW wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 100 m operating at full load the velocity deficit is of the order of 5%, the wind direction change is increased with 1?2 deg, and the velocity recovery distance is 20 rotor diameters. For a wind farm with 22 of these turbines separated at 10 rotor distances these numbers are 15%, 2?3 deg, and at least 2 wind farm length scales. Initial velocity deficits and velocity recovery distances show the impact of nominal power density and geostrophic velocity for a wind farm which consists of 22 wind turbines with a nominal power of 5 MW.

At this hub-height velocity the absolute initial velocity deficit reaches a maximum (of 1.2 m/s in the case of a nominal power density of 5 MW/km 2) and the velocity recovery distance relative to the wind farm length scale is of the order of 20. The relative velocity recovery distance for other geostrophic velocities varies between 0 (at low geostrophic velocities) and a limit value of the order of 40 (at high velocities)."""

However, the intermittency of wind and solar power is a major obstacle to their broader use. The additional risks of unexpected interruptions and mismatch with demand have hindered the expansion of these two primary renewable resources. The goal of this research is to analyze an integrated energy system that includes a novel configuration of wind and solar coupled with two storage methods to make both wind and solar sources dispatchable during peak demand, thereby enabling their broader use. The proposed system utilizes compressed air energy storage (CAES) that is driven from wind energy and thermal storage supplied by concentrated solar thermal power in order to achieve this desired dispatchability. While current CAES facilities use off peak electricity to power their compressors, this system uses power from wind turbines to compress air to high pressure for storage. Also, rather than using natural gas for heating of the compressed air before its expansion through a turbine, which it typical for conventional systems, the system described in this paper replaces the use of natural gas with solar thermal energy and thermal storage. Through a thermodynamic and a levelised lifetime cost analysis we have been able to develop estimates of the power system performance and the cost of energy for this integrated wind-solar-storage system. What we found is that the combination of these components resulted in an efficiency of over 50% for the main power components.

Control strategies that will enable a pitch regulated variable speed 2MW turbine to produce power at wind speeds beyond the normal cut-out wind speed of 25m/s without substantially increasing the loads are investigated. A set of load cases for wind speeds from 4m/s to 50m/s for a IEC61400-1 rev 3 class IA turbine has been performed. Statistics in terms of mean value and standard deviation are analysed and rainflow calculations are performed to estimate the impact over the lifetime of the turbine. Initially, an alternative power-speed control to the traditional approach is investigated, in which the rotor speed and power set-points are gradually reduced, for increasing wind speeds above the cut-out wind speed of 25m/s. With the above suggested control strategy, it is possible to limit the rotor loads but the tower vibration loads, both fore-aft and side-to-side, are still increasing. As a result, additional load reduction controllers are investigated. First, a fore-aft tower damper algorithm using collective pitch based on measurements of the fore-aft tower top acceleration signal and second, a side-toside tower damper algorithm using an additional torque demand, based on measurements of the side-to-side tower top acceleration, makes significant load reductions of the fore-aft and side-to-side tower loading possible.

The challenge for the grid operator of integrating wind energy, or for the energy trader to maximise the market value of the energy, is toughest during periods of rapid change in wind farm production, or ramp events. These events are also tough to forecast accurately, and it is therefore essential to understand the uncertainty of forecasting such events. To date the majority of work on the uncertainty of wind energy forecasts has been focused on the possible amplitude of wind production that might occur at a given time. However, there has been limited investigation into effectively defining the possible timing of significant wind energy events. This paper aims to focus on methodologies for generating temporal forecast uncertainty for rapid changes in wind farm production. The first challenge is to define ramp events, secondly the forecast uncertainty needs to be calculated and finally this information needs to be presented clearly to the end user.

Therefore understanding the background of a research is at least as important as the results. Extraction of bioenergy needs also energy that is usually assumed to be fossil energy. To extract fossil energy requires considerably less efforts than that of bioenergy, which makes bioenergy chains look more energy efficient than they really are. Additionally, the indirect energy input is often inadequately analyzed and underestimated. The output energy of a biomass production chain is usually expressed as a heating value of the dry matter. However, heat is at a low level in the energy hierarchy. Refining biomass to a higher level (such as electricity or traffic fuel) causes energy losses and decreases the output. Thus energy quality should be properly included in the analysis. Biomass production needs favorable growing conditions, wind energy needs wind, and solar energy needs sunshine.

Short duration wind tunnels such as shock tunnels and gun tunnels rely on a transient compression process and are likely to generate significant turbulent fluctuations in the nozzle reservoir region. In the present study, the magnitude of likely stagnation temperature fluctuations in two such facilities is inferred from incompressible temperature fluctuations data obtained by other workers. The friction velocity Reynolds numbers for the gun tunnel and shock tunnel cases considered presently were Re?= 31,579 and 24,975 respectively. The RMS stagnation temperature fluctuations, when averaged over the pipe flow diameter, are estimated to be 14.6 and 278 K for the gun tunnel and shock tunnel cases respectively. The estimated RMS value in the case of the gun tunnel is significantly larger than the experimental value previously measured on the centre line of the gun tunnel nozzle of 2.3 K. The difference observed between the inferred and measured temperature fluctuations in the gun tunnel case may be related to spatial variations in the temperature fluctuations. In the case of the shock tunnel, the magnitude of the fluctuations is demonstrated to be significant for supersonic combustion experiments. The present approach for estimating the magnitude temperature fluctuations should be refined, but more detailed measurements of temperature fluctuations in such facilities are also required. ©2009 IEEE."""

Besides this direct application, knowledge of the regional characteristics of a wave field can also help in the selection of optimal regions for wave power energy plant design and installation.

The hindcast covered the period from January 1997 to December 2005 in a region between 5°N - 40°S and 10°W - 65°W. The grid used was uniform with a 0.25° spacial resolution. The boundary conditions were obtained from NOAA WW3 operational model and the atmospheric forcing from NOAA GFS model. The model results were calibrated with field data and detailed information about the simulation can be obtained in Alves et al.(2008) and Alves et al. (in press). Monthly averages of significant height, period and wavelength were calculated using 3 hour time resolution fields. Since a simple mean direction has small physical representativeness, the predominant direction (moda) and associated persistency were obtained from the data. The results were then compared with values from the U.S. Navy Marine Climate Atlas of the World. This Atlas has four points located within the selected model grid region. These points showed good agreement with wave period, height and direction persistency based on the WW3 simulation results. The wave climatology showed that the predominant wave direction from April to July was from S and SE in southern Brazil, associated with swells related to cold fronts. The S and SE swells were also responsible for the largest mean wave height (2.1 m) observed in the climatology. Another result that was validated with the literature was the E and NE predominant wave direction during the austral summer. This phenomenon is associated with winds originated from the South Atlantic High Pressure Center, which is a semi permanent high pressure center near Trindade Island. The wave climate in northern Brazil showed a predominant direction from the N during January to March, associated with the northern hemisphere winter storms. During the remaining months of the year, the predominant wave direction is E and NE associated with trade winds.

Environmental impacts include market externalities such as the environmental impacts on air, land, and water, and are normalized per kWh generated (for example, pounds of CO2 or NOx, acres of land, or gallons of cooling water consumed per kWh of generated electricity). Environmental impacts can further be associated with a cost, which is included in the overall levelized cost of electricity.

For wires with three different anchoring groups, dithiol, diamine, or dicarboxylic acid, the low bias conductances resulting from the four binding modes are all found to have either a high or a low value, well consistent with recent experimental observations.

Latent (evaporation) and sensible heat fluxes were towards the atmosphere and the lagoon, respectively for most of the day. A diurnal cycle in atmospheric and lagoon temperatures was also observed. Furthermore, wind speeds above the lagoon were highest in the afternoon. These variations were linked to lagoon temperature stratifications which became more pronounced as wind speeds increased. Temperature stratification at the lagoon indicated increased heat exchange at the lagoon's interface with the atmosphere. During the night, the stratification disappeared and temperatures in the water column were almost identical down to about 60 cm. This behavior is similar to that observed in other shallow water bodies that are fetch-limited. Lagoon heating was driven by the diurnal cycle of solar radiation and net radiation.

These assumptions and impacts include changes to market prices of energy, operating reserve requirements, annual electrical energy production, hypothetical value of wind energy, and generating capacity and energy exchanges on the market. From the initial results and annual analyses of these simulation and optimization modeling runs, several observations can be made. 1) The hydroelectric utility could increase the value of wind energy very slightly (0.1% to 0.02% for wind capacity penetration levels 3% to 12%) during a dry water year if allowed the option of curtailing wind power, but still requiring it to pay the wind power producer for all available wind power. 2) Under the same requirements, but during a wet water year, the value of wind energy could increase a greater amount: 0.2% to 1.0% for wind capacity penetration levels 3% to 12%. 3) For either the dry or wet water year, total annual wind energy curtailment is less than 2.5%.

The two ways are time-period-based and risk-based approaches. The time-period-based approach defines the availability of wind power during a peak load period with a certain probability that is based on wind power generation statistics. The risk-based approach utilizes the loss of load probability (LOLP). In addition, the two approaches are used to define the capacity credit of wind power in Finland. The results show that the capacity credit in Finland would be 6% of the installed wind power capacity with the timeperiod-based method and 10% with the risk-based method respectively. Finally, different meanings of the concept capacity credit in different contexts are discussed and new terms for capacity credit are suggested in order to avoid confusion of concepts. The advantages of the time-period-based approach are its direct implementation and the fact that it takes into account the variability and unavailability of wind power without complex reliability models. In addition, the time-period-based approach can give the availability of different types of generation independently of other production forms and it suits well to Nordel's way to estimate the power balance. The estimation of capacity credit is based on simultaneously measured wind generation and load data. The risk-based approach gives the added value of wind power capacity to the power system. It considers the reliability of all generation concepts and is a widely used approach. There are though some disadvantages: it requires lot of information about the power system in question and power system simulations are needed. Finally, the capacity credit of wind power calculated by risk-based method cannot directly be applied for power balance studies made in the Nordel, because the Nordic definition of capacity credit for other generation types is based on the different approach. The concept """"capacity credit"""" is used at least in two different ways: 1) it is the available wind power generation during the peak load period, which is not dependent on the power system it is connected to and 2) it is the value of additional wind power capacity on power system in terms of power system security, which is system dependent. Both definitions are correct. They are calculated with different methods and are often used in different contexts, which can create confusion. One has to be exact with definition if using the term capacity credit to avoid misunderstanding. Instead of capacity credit we recommend to use concepts """"available wind power generation"""" and """"capacity value of wind power"""". © CIGRE2009."""

The observed wind data were processed as annual and seasonal by means of the FORTRAN computer code. Weibull and Rayleigh probability density functions of the location using actual data are calculated. For Pinarbasi County, in the considered years, Weibull shape parameter k and scale parameter c vary between values of 1.40 and 1.59 and 3.91 and 4.26 m/s, respectively. In Pinarbasi, the mean power density varies between 65 and 90 W/ m2 according to actual data while between 75 and 100 W/ m2 according to Weibull data. In addition, for Pinarbasi, the maximum value of the mean power density according to actual data for the winter season is 170 W/ m2 in 2001. Mean power density in all of the considered years for Pinarbasi is considerable in winter and spring.

The expanded ensemble density of states (EXEDOS) [E. B. Kim, R. Faller, Q. Yan, J. Chem. Phys. 117, 7781 (2002)] is a simple flat-histogram Monte Carlo method based on the density of states algorithm proposed by Wang and Landau [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 2050 (2001)]. EXEDOS offers the advantage of continuous uniform sampling of the RC with no a priori knowledge of the free energy profile. However, the method is not certain to converge within accessible simulation time. Furthermore, the strongly asymmetric distribution of tunneling times inherent in flat-histogram sampling imposes additional limitations. We propose several improvements that accelerate the EXEDOS method and can be generally applicable in free energy calculations. First, we propose an asynchronous parallel implementation of the density of states algorithm in a multiple-walkers multiple-windows scheme and extend the algorithm in an expanded ensemble [(MW)2 -XDOS] for PMF calculations as the original EXEDOS. Despite the nonideal scaling over a number of processors this technique overcomes limitations by extreme values of tunneling times and allows consistent evaluations of performance. The second set of improvements addresses the dependence of convergence times on system size, density, and sampling rate of the RC. At low densities, the coupling of (MW) 2 -XDOS with the rejection-free geometric cluster move provides impressive performance that overshadows any other technique. However, the limited applicability of cluster moves at high densities requires an alternative approach. We propose the coupling of (MW) 2 -XDOS with preferential sampling methods. In the systems studied, single displacements in the proximity of particles defining the RC accelerate calculations significantly and render the simulation nearly size-independent. A further modification of preferential sampling involves collective displacements of particles performed in a """"smart Monte Carlo"""" scheme.

The ratio of the turbulent kinetic energy production over dissipation rate appears to show a similar dependence on the initial value of the shear parameter, but there is more significant scatter in the data.

The probability of a combination of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and deep tropospheric wind shear being associated with significant severe thunderstorms has been calculated for both areas. Probabilities of significant severe storms are higher for high CAPE and shear in Europe, but those large scale environmental conditions are experienced much more frequently in the US, so that the overall number of events is much higher in the US. Probabilities of significant storms are approximately constant for constant values of CAPE*Shear for each of the datasets.

The stoss angles could generally be divided into two groups based on the profiles of mean velocity, turbulence and Reynolds stress. Stoss angles of 3° and 5° usually had similar profiles, and angles of 15°, 20° and 25° formed a second group with similar profiles. The profiles for the stoss angle of 10° were usually transitional and were intermediate between the two groups. Vorticity, Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy increased monotonically with increasing free-stream wind velocity, but their variations with respect to the stoss angle were complex.

Environmental and economic concerns have yet to be fully reconciled. One view is that decisions that incorporate both society's concern with the environment and investors' desire for shareholder value maximization are more likely to be truly sustainable. We coin the term dual sustainability to mean the achievement of environmental and financial sustainability simultaneously. Many experts believe that wind energy can help to meet society's needs without harming future generations. It is clean and renewable. Because the fuel is free it provides the ultimate in energy independence. Wind energy has emerged as a leading prospect, in part, because it is considered by many to be environmentally sustainable. However, a key question that remains is whether wind energy is financially sustainable without the extensive government support that has helped to create and nurture this growth industry. Using reliable, proprietary data from field research, our analysis employs a capital budgeting framework to evaluate the financial economics of investments in wind energy. We find that because of the convergence of improved technology, greater efficiency, and with the increasing cost of traditional, competing sources such as oil and natural gas, wind energy is close to becoming self-sustaining financially without the extensive federal government support that exists today. Wind energy can provide the best of both worlds. It is sustainable from an environmental perspective and it is becoming sustainable financially. In short, those companies investing in wind energy will be able to do well by doing good. Perhaps the achievement of dual sustainability is true sustainability.

This is accomplished by allowing for load shedding as an expensive option to meet contingencies. The high cost of """"energy-not-served"""" implies that some equipment can be very valuable in contingencies if it reduces the amount of energy-not-served. Calculating the nodal prices correctly for different states of the system provides the basis for determining the economic value of improved reliability and investments in additional network capacity. The objective of this paper is to extend the co-optimization framework to determine the net economic benefit of adding an intermittent source of generation, such as wind capacity, and new transmission capacity to a network. Using the co-optimization framework, this situation can be represented by defining new contingencies that correspond to unpredicted changes in the level of generation from the wind capacity. Using the SuperOPF, the amount of additional reserve capacity that is required to maintain reliability with higher levels of wind penetration is determined endogenously. An empirical example illustrates how the SuperOPF can be used to determine the expected annual cost of meeting load after wind capacity is installed at a remote location. These annual costs are reduced when additional transmission capacity is installed to reduce congestion in transferring wind generation to a load center. Hence, the economic issue is to determine whether the savings in production costs are high enough to cover the annualized cost of investing in the new transmission capacity. © 2009 IEEE."""

Overspeed control is performed by a furling mechanism. The turbine has the unique feature of being capable of operating at either 12, 24 or 48V system voltage, requiring no load control in any case. In the 48 V configuration, the system is capable of providing 2kWh day -1 for an average wind speed as low as 3.5ms -1 and an air density of 85% of the standard pressure and temperature value. The experimental assessment has been conducted under field conditions with the turbine mounted on a 20m guy-wired tubular tower. The experimental power curves are shown to be in good agreement with a detailed aerodynamical and electromechanical model of the turbine for non-furling conditions and for wind speeds above the theoretical cut-in speed. In the case of the rapidly spinning load configurations, a finite power production at wind speeds below the theoretical cut-in speed can be observed, which can be explained in terms of inertia effects. During the measurement campaigns with high loads, we were able to observe bifurcations of the power curve, which can be explained in terms of instabilities arising in situations of transition from attached to separated flow.

Anomalous cosmic rays are thought to be generated from pick-up ions that undergo Fermi-1 acceleration in the region close to the solar wind termination shock. This selective acceleration process depends on the efficiency at which upstream pick-up ions are injected into the first reflection mode, from where acceleration into higher energy anomalous cosmic rays starts. Aims. The injection efficiency is highly sensitive to the local inclination of the upstream magnetic field with respect to the shock normal. We determine the probability of pick-up ions being reflected at the shock depending on the magnetic inclination angle, which varies characteristically with latitude and longitude. This reflection is the relevant initial step in the acceleration of pickup ions to anomalous cosmic rays.Methods. We point out that the most dramatic change in the magnetic tilt angle occurs whenever two consecutive solar wind sector structures with different magnetic polarities, pass over the shock. We treat this effect by modeling the 3D- variation of the injection efficiency and start from calculations of the pick up ion reflection probability as function of the magnetic tilt angle. We first derive the magnetic tilt angle as function of latitude and longitude, representing the 3D-shape of the termination shock by a triaxial or prolate ellipsoid adaptable for conditions of different solar cycles, respectively. This allows us to semi-analytically express the 3D-variation of the injection efficiency and rate over a solar cycle.Results. We find a substantial variation in the injection efficiency by 5 orders of magnitude when passing from the upwind parts to the flanks of the termination shock or from low to high latitudes (except at the poles). Folding this with the normalized pickup ion density gives a normalized injection rate which increases from 0% to 30% from upwind to crosswind directions and analogously decreases from crosswind into downwind direction. The maximal value of the injection rate highly depends on the underlying sector structure of the heliospheric magnetic field. During solar minimum there is almost no injection in high latitudes, except at the pole itself, while the injection rate is everywhere fairly good during solar maximum.Conclusions. Our model indicates that the injection into the anomalous cosmic ray acceleration mainly takes place in crosswind directions e.g. in the flanks of the termination shock. © 2009 ESO."""

This paper proposes a technique to calculate the optimal amount of SR that the system operator should provide to be able to respond not only to generation outages but also to errors in the forecasts for load and wind power production.

Three methods based on GA for achieving MPPT are discussed in this paper: (1) full-sensor control with anemometer and tachometer, (2) rule-based method and (3) adaptive duty cycle method. The third method has merits of no PID parameters, proportional constant, anemometer, tachometer and characteristics of WTGS required. This method enables the permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) to operate at variable speeds to achieve good performance. Simulation results show that the tip-speed ratio (TSR) and power coefficient obtained by the adaptive duty cycle method with GA can be almost identical to the optimal values. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Large helicity existed downshear of the storm center with respect to the ambient vertical wind shear. It was associated with veering, semicircular hodographs created by strong, vortex-scale, radial-vertical flow induced by the shear. The most extreme values of helicity, among the largest ever reported in the literature, occurred in the vicinity of deep convective cells in the downshear-left quadrant. These cells reached as high as 17.5 km and displayed the temporal and spatial scales of supercells. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) averaged 861 J kg-1 downshear, but only about one-third as large upshear. The soundings nearest the deep cells were evaluated using two empirical supercell parameters that make use of CAPE, helicity, and/or shear. These parameters supported the possible existence of supercells as a consequence of the exceptional helicity combined with moderate but sufficient CAPE.

Of particular interest are the turbulent heat and momentum fluxes in the breaking wave and their roles in shaping the wave-scale and larger-scale flows. The evolution of the breaking wave in the ensemble mean is found to be broadly consistent with prior low-resolution calculations. A turbulent kinetic energy budget for the wave shows that the turbulence production is almost entirely due to the mean shear. Most of the production is at the top of the leeside shooting flow, where the mean-flow Richardson number is persistently less than 0.25. The turbulent dissipation of mean-flow wave energy is shown to result mainly from the turbulent momentum fluxes - specifically, from the tendency of these fluxes to act counter to the mean-flow disturbance wind. Of particular importance is the eddy deceleration of the leeside shooting flow. The resulting momentum dissipation leads to a mean-flow Bernoulli loss, a cross-stream mean-flow PV flux, and a permanent upward mean-flow vorticity transfer. The dependence of the turbulent fluxes on grid spacing is considered by computing a series of ensembles with grid spacings ranging from L/56 to L/3.7 (where L is the mountain half-width). At the highest resolution, the eddy fluxes are mostly resolved, but with increasing grid spacing, the resolved-scale fluxes decline and the parameterized fluxes become larger.

The contraction stage of upper-level disturbances that follows their elongation stage leads to an increase of eddy kinetic energy that is called the barotropic regeneration process in this text. This barotropic mechanism is studied through notions of barotropic critical regions (BtCRs) and effective deformation that have been introduced in a previous paper. The effective deformation field is equal to the difference between the square of the large-scale deformation magnitude and the square of the large-scale vorticity. Regions where the effective deformation is positive correspond to regions where the large-scale flow tends to strongly stretch synoptic disturbances. A BtCR is an area separating two large-scale regions of positive effective deformation, one located upstream and on the south side of the jet and the other downstream and on the north side. Such a region presents a discontinuity in the orientation of the dilatation axes and is a potential area where the barotropic regeneration process may occur. Winter days presenting a zonal weather regime in the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis dataset are decomposed, via a partitioning algorithm, into different configurations of the effective deformation field at 300 hPa. A six-cluster partition is obtained. Composite maps of the barotropic generation rate for each cluster exhibit a succession of negative and positive values on both sides of the BtCRs. It confirms statistically that the barotropic regeneration mechanism occurs preferentially about BtCRs. Numerical experiments using a forced barotropic model on the sphere are performed. Each experiment consists of adding a synoptic-scale perturbation to one of the zonal-like jet configurations found in observations, which is kept fixed with time.

The frequency stability is governed by the inertia of the rotating masses of the generators and the response of their primary frequency regulation. Frequency stability is a key aspect of the operation of power systems. In large interconnected power systems like the European one, the large rotating kinetic energy and the quality of the primary frequency regulation has prevented frequency stability to affect both quality and security of the supply of electrical energy. However, the incident of the European system of November 4, 2006 has proved that severe disturbances that lead to large frequency excursions can occur. Such frequency excursions led to the tripping of large amounts wind power generation in a number of countries because of the settings of the frequency relays of the wind power generators. This paper contains a fundamental study on the impact of wind power generators in the frequency stability of synchronous generators. Wind power generators of different technologies (squirrel cage and doubly fed induction generators and on multi-pole synchronous generators) have been considered. Two simple test systems have been developed for this purpose. The first test system contains a synchronous generator feeding a load. The second test system comprises of a synchronous and a wind power generator feeding a load. It has been found that when the system includes wind power generators, the steady-state value of the frequency after of a generation-load unbalance (i.e. a generator tripping) is determined by primary frequency regulation capability of both the synchronous and the wind power generators. If wind power generators do not provide primary regulation, the transient variation of the frequency depends on the inertia of the synchronous generators and the speed of primary frequency regulation of the synchronous generators. It means that systems with high wind power penetration will experience larger transient frequency excursions in case of generation trip due to the lack of inertia of the wind power generators."""

Relative changes of these amplitudes in space and time were studied also. It was revealed, that at the initial stage of the wave transformation, the changes of amplitudes of the first and the second harmonics are similar and amplitudes of the second harmonics are proportional to the squared amplitudes of the first harmonics. At this stage the variability of parameters of individual irregular waves can be explained by Stokes theory. Nearer to the coast the instantaneous values of the amplitudes of the first and the second harmonics varies in time chaotically and is not possible to construct a simple model of the variability of the parameters of individual irregular waves.

The dynamical and statistical description of stably stratified turbulent boundary layers with the important example of the stable atmospheric boundary layer in mind is addressed. Traditional approaches to this problem, based on the profiles of mean quantities, velocity second-order correlations and dimensional estimates of the turbulent thermal flux, run into a well-known difficulty, predicting the suppression of turbulence at a small critical value of the Richardson number, in contradiction to observations. Phenomenological attempts to overcome this problem suffer from various theoretical inconsistencies. Here, we present an approach taking into full account all the second-order statistics, which allows us to respect the conservation of total mechanical energy. The analysis culminates in an analytic solution of the profiles of all mean quantities and all second-order correlations, removing the unphysical predictions of previous theories. We propose that the approach taken here is sufficient to describe the lower parts of the atmospheric boundary layer, as long as the Richardson number does not exceed an order of unity.

The identification of dominant wind speeds is important to ensure an adequate number of simulations at such speeds, which often influence extrapolated loads. In-plane loads and deflections tended to be dominated by high wind speeds near cut-out wind speed. Out-ofplane loads and deflections were most influenced by winds that were near the rated wind speed.

As it is not feasible to simulate a full lifetime of fluctuating wind turbine loads to determine the largest extreme value, extrapolation to a 50 year or other desired long-term return period is performed based on limited simulation data. For specific wind turbine component design, it is required to identify other simultaneously applied loading corresponding to this long-term extrapolated load level. This identification is performed using statistical methods, since an appropriate loads simulation time series directly giving loads at the extrapolated load level is unavailable. The statistical behavior of each contemporaneous load in the simulation time series that was used to determine the extrapolated load is illustrated by the histogram. Since this histogram is in general skewed, the mean value of the corresponding data may not be an appropriate value for such contemporaneous loads. Instead, in this paper, a value corresponding to the mode of the estimated probability distribution function of the contemporaneous load is used. The robustness of ascertaining this most probable contemporaneous load is also investigated.

Although the wind stress is uniform, the near-inertial motion field quickly becomes spatially heterogeneous, involving horizontal scales much smaller than the eddy scales. Analysis confirms that refraction by the eddy relative vorticity is the main mechanism responsible for the horizontal distortion of the near-inertial motions, which subsequently triggers their vertical propagation. An important result is the appearance of two maxima of near-inertial vertical velocity (both with rms values reaching 40 m day-1): one at a depth of 100 m and another unexpected one much below the main thermocline around 1700 m. The shallow maximum, captured by the highest vertical normal modes, involves near-inertial motions with a spatial heterogeneity close to the eddy vorticity gradient field. These characteristics match analytical results obtained with Young and Ben Jelloul's approach. The deep maximum, captured by the lowest vertical normal modes, involves superinertial motions with a frequency of twice the inertial frequency and much smaller horizontal scales.

A simple numerical model of a mesocyclone is constructed in order to rule out other tornadogenesis mechanisms in the simulations. The flow is axisymmetric and Boussinesq with constant eddy viscosity in a neutrally stratified environment. The domain is closed to avoid artificial decoupling of a vortex from the storm-scale circulation. In the principal simulation, the initial condition is a balanced, slowly decaying, Beltrami flow describing an updraft that is rotating cyclonically at midlevels around a low pressure center surrounded by a concentric downdraft that revolves cyclonically but has anticyclonic vorticity. The boundary conditions are no slip on the tangential wind and free slip on the radial or vertical wind to accommodate this initial condition and to allow strong interaction of a vortex with the ground. Precipitation is released through the top above the updraft and falls to the ground near the updraft-downdraft interface in an annular curtain. The downdraft enhancement induced by the precipitation drag upsets the balance of the Beltrami flow, The downdraft and its outflow toward the axis increase low-level convergence beneath the updraft and transport air with moderately high angular momentum downward and inward where it is entrained and stretched by the updraft. The resulting tornado has a comer region with an intense axial jet and low pressure capped by a vortex breakdown and a transition toa broader vortex aloft (a tornado cyclone). A clear slot of subsiding air with anticyclonic vorticity surrounds the vortex. The vertical kinetic energy of the entire circulation declines dramatically prior to tornado formation. © 2008 American Meteorological Society."""

The surface drag dependence on fetch and wind then closely follows the dominant wave steepness dependence. It is found that the dimensionless roughness length z0* varies not only with wind forcing (or inverse wave age) but also with fetch. At a fixed fetch, when gravity waves develop, z0* decreases with wind forcing according to a -1/2 power law.

Three steps constitute our method. First, we map the available area, delimiting bathymetric areas based on turbine tower technology, then assess competing uses of the ocean to establish exclusion zones. From exclusion zones, bathymetry, and turbine tower water depth limitations, the water sheet area available for wind turbines is calculated. The second step is calculation of power production starting from available area, which determines the location and count of turbines. Then existing wind data are extrapolated to turbine height and, along with the turbine power output curve, they are used to establish the expected electric power production on an hourly basis. The third step calculates market value based on the hourly electric market at the nearest electric grid node. To illustrate these methods, we assess the offshore wind resource of the US state of Delaware. We find year-round average output of over 5200 MW, or about four times the average electrical consumption of the state. On local wholesale electricity markets, this would produce just over $2 billion/year in revenue. Because the methods described here do not rely on constructing meteorological towers nor on proprietary software, they are more accessible to a local government, state college, or other organization.

Over the last century, the lower 75% of APDIs appear randomly sampled from a nearly uniform distribution, and the upper 25% of APDIs from a nearly lognormal distribution. From the latter distribution, a baseline (SST-independent) stochastic model was derived predicting that over the next half century, APDI will not likely exceed its maximum value over the last half century by more than a factor of 1.5. This factor increased to 2 using a baseline model modified to assume SST-dependence conditioned on an upper bound of the increasing NAO SST trend observed since 1970.

In this paper, the classical Prandtl model for one-dimensional flow of a viscous stably stratified fluid along a uniformly cooled sloping planar surface is extended to include the simplest type of surface inhomogeneity - a surface buoyancy that varies linearly down the slope. The inhomogeneity gives rise to acceleration, vertical motions associated with low-level convergence, and horizontal and vertical advection of perturbation buoyancy. Such processes are not accounted for in the classical Prandtl model. A similarity hypothesis appropriate for this inhomogeneous flow removes the along-slope dependence from the problem, and, in the steady state, reduces the Boussinesq equations of motion and thermodynamic energy to a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Asymptotic solutions for the velocity and buoyancy variables in the steady state, valid for large values of the slope-normal coordinate, are obtained for a Prandtl number of unity for pure katabatic flow with no ambient wind or externally imposed pressure gradient. The undetermined parameters in these solutions are adjusted to conform to lower boundary conditions of no-slip, impermeability and specified buoyancy. These solutions yield formulae for the boundary-layer thickness and slope-normal velocity component at the top of the boundary layer, and provide an upper bound of the along-slope surface-buoyancy gradient beyond which steady-state solutions do not exist. Although strictly valid for flow above the boundary layer, the steady asymptotic solutions are found to be in very good agreement with the terminal state of the numerical solution of an initial-value problem (suddenly applied surface buoyancy) throughout the flow domain.

Actions and structural safety criteria during construction are referred in bridge codes but not always specified. It is a designer responsibility to decide on the referred criteria. Simplified approaches are discussed, illustrated by design cases based on the author's design experience. A basic issue at ULS during the erection stages is the definition of the construction loads and partial safety coefficients ?g and ?q for the fundamental load combinations, associated to permanent (G) and variable loads (Q) namely construction loads and wind loads. During first erection stages (Fig. 1) of a BC bridge, the stability of the piers requires a geometrical and material nonlinear analysis or at least an approximate method to estimate the nonlinear effects. The approximate second order bending moment at the base section of the pier may be taken as: Msd = ?gPwmax + 1/2 ?q q? (1) where wmax is the maximum second order deflection at the top, P the total load at the top including 1/3 of the self weight (P?) of the pier and q the transverse load due to wind. For wmaxone takes (Formula Presented) Here ?o is the amplitude of the geometrical imperfection at the top, and the critical load Pcr,ef is determinate for the effective (cracked) bending stiffness EIef of the pier section, at the initial yielding of the reinforcement under bending and axial force. During the balanced cantilever scheme of a curved box girder bridge (Fig. 1b), the dead load of the deck induces transverse bending moments in the piers, unless some provisional prestressing internal or external, is adopted. To get a full balance of the transverse bending moments in the pier shaft, it requires a prestressing force Po = 1/Re ?i Gni xi2 (3) where R is the radius of curvature and Gnithe nominal weights of the segments. The bending moments ?My are due to deviations in Gni and the bending moment Mx are due to the inplan curvature. Balanced cantilever bridges, with tall piers, present low natural frequencies in bending and torsional modes of the pier (Fig. 1). It is usual to have longitudinal and transverse bending frequencies and torsional frequencies fx,fy and ft respectively for tall piers (say between 60 and 100 m) and spans between 100 and 180 m in the range 0.1 Hz to 0.4 Hz. An example is shown in Fig. 1(a) where fx = 0.17 Hz and f t = 0.29 Hz. Under random excitation and due to wind gusts, bending and torsional effects due to unbalanced wind buffeting shall be considered in design when checking the structural safety during construction stages. The characteristic average wind speeds (Uk,50) are usually defined for time intervals of 10 minutes in a reference period of 50 years. For checking the structure during construction one adopts a shorter reference period T, say T = 10 years for a construction time not greater than 1 year. The associated characteristic averages wind speed may be estimated as Uk,T = U k,50 (1-0071 ?n 50/T) (4) yielding for T = 10 years U k,T = 0,88 Uk,50, i.e. a 23% reduction in the wind loads which are function of U2. In the case of a BC bridge during construction (Fig. 1) the symmetry of deck with respect to the pier yields a zero mean torsional moment due to the wind actions. If one takes into consideration the fluctuations of the wind speed along the overhangs, the wind speed does not reach the maximum value at each point x and (-x) simultaneous. One may keep the concept of a gust factor ?t for the torsional moment Tk (characteristic value) if one takes the torsional moment Th induced in the pier by the mean wind speed acting in one of the cantilevers only (half deck), i.e.Tk = ?T Th The approaches to evaluate Tk are quite complex and in many cases limited by specific constraints of the design case as the topographic influence induced in the wind speeds in a bridge located in a valley. The piers may be to close to the slopes to disregard this effect (Fig. 1). To model this effect numerically may be very complex. Only model studies in wind tunnels may give sufficient reliable results for design practice. These wind tunnel tests may be based on rigid models assuming the geometry of the BC bridge is not susceptible to any aerodynamic instability effects. Reducing the analysis of the structural response to the first 3 modes, it is possible to show the generalized aerodynamic forces may be evaluated from the moments measured in the rigid model in the deck and in the pier. From results based on the theorical approaches previously referred, one may say that for spans L up to 80 m, the approach based on the mean wind speed in one overhang only i.e ?T = 1 is acceptable. For 80 &lt"	 L &lt	 180m, values of ?T reaching values up to 2,5 may be obtained. For BC bridges located in valleys, with large spans (say L &gt	" 120 m), either a wind tunnel test is made or some temporary cables anchoring the deck to the hill may be installed, as was the case of Fig. 1(a). Cable stayed bridges, with a prestressed concrete or a composite deck are usually built by the cantilever method. The deck may be erected by a balanced cantilever scheme from each mast or by an """"unbalanced"""" asymmetric scheme if lateral spans have been previously erected as usually in single mast cables stayed bridges (Fig. 2). The adjustment of the forces in the stays is made in order to control the internal forces in the deck (force control) as well as to reach a previously defined camber plan (geometry control). Assuming a linear elastic response, the influence matrix of the forces of the stays, at each construction stage, can be determined. Hence a vector {xj} - adjustment of the forces in the stays, represents the design parameters at each construction stage. The stay forces are evaluated with an equivalent modulus of elasticity Eeq given by Ernst formula, which approach Eo under increasing loading. The forces in the stays may be checked during construction by comparing the values measured in the stressing operations with the values determined from the measured natural vibration frequencies of an equivalent string. The main issue, is the definition of the """"free"""" length L because, for short stays the influence of the anchorage length may be meaningful. Using the measurements from an accelerometer, the eigenfrequencies may be identifying from a power spectrum (Fig. 2b). © 2006 Taylor &amp"	" Francis Group."""

The machine has a High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) field winding and a conventional stator winding. It has a small footprint and is readily transportable in a trailerized format, making it easily placed in substations. This HTS DSC enhances system utilization through reactive compensation by dynamically injecting leading or lagging VARs as needed. At this site, the testing is intended to show not only that the HTS DSC is a new, preferred option for handling arc furnace flicker, but also that the device will handle hundreds of thousands of transmission transients daily. The machine has been absorbing transient disturbances with very high negative (>30%) and zero (>15%) sequence current components. The rotor with a continuous damper winding in the form of a copper shell absorbs heating created by negative and zero sequence currents very effectively with an insignificant temperature rise. The stator winding has also withstood these currents while staying within the peak allowable temperature. This machine is not prone to reduction in life of a conventional synchronous machine field winding due to load changes because the HTS field winding requires only a small change in field current between no-load and full-load and it always operates at a constant cryogenic temperature. This HTS machine uses less than half of the energy of a conventional synchronous compensator and about the same amount of energy as a modern Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device consumes. The machine was first synchronized with the grid in October 2004 and has been regularly operating since January 2005. This paper discusses transients experienced by the machine and VARs it supplies during a typical burn cycle of the furnace. Possible alternate applications of this machine are discussed to address steady-state and transient problems in an electric grid. These machines are a stable dynamic source of leading or lagging VARs for voltage regulation in a power system. The HTS DSC can supply several times its rating for short periods of time to support the grid during a voltage instability (voltage collapse) situation. It can also inject several times its rated current into a system fault (automatically without intervention of operators) and let the system ride through disturbances. The HTS DSC can be utilized for solving problems such as 1) power quality as affected by large motor starting, 2) voltage regulation by injecting appropriate VAR power dynamically, 3) replacing the VAR output of Reliability Must Run (RMR) generators, and 4) avoiding voltage instability by injecting VARs. In wind farm installations, they can supply dynamic VARs for voltage regulation and to meet the reactive needs of induction generators.

As a consequence, the construction of new and the management of existing infrastructure are today posing complex economical and technological problems to owners, governmental bodies and societal organizations worldwide. The economical effort of building, replacing or retrofitting of infrastructure is particularly important in industrialized countries, where the existing infrastructure stock is subjected to ageing and obsolescence. For example, the majority of the transportation infrastructure existing in the Europe and in the United States has been built from the 50's to the 70's, when the characteristics of the traffic intensity and loads were significantly different from that of today and when some of the phenomena related to material degradation were not fully discovered or understood. Moreover, the problem is not confined to transportation infrastructure, but also includes other types of infrastructure like energy production and distribution systems, water supplies and wastewater treatment plants, communication facilities, schools, hospitals, homeland defense installations, etc. The development of infrastructure management systems able to optimize the costs needed to keep existing facilities at an acceptable level of performance has been therefore the subject of extensive research activity in the past few decades, leading in some cases to standardized codes of practice but also giving rise, especially as concerning the statement of global approaches, to challenging interdisciplinary problems that the scientific community has come to face in the more recent years and that represent a very promising research field in civil engineering. Basically, to establish a global approach to the management of existing infrastructure, an optimal strategy for programming maintenance and retrofitting interventions shall be found in such a way to minimize some """"cost"""" function while keeping some """"performance"""" or """"condition"""" measure (index) within a specified acceptable bound. Maintenance interventions may be decided on the basis of time or condition, cost and cost-condition relationship to the aim of preventing excessive degradation of the performance indices and delay retrofitting activities that have the scope of carrying the performance indices back to their target values. There are many parameters that influence the decision making process, like the law of degradation and the effect of the interventions on it. Essentially these parameters are of a stochastic nature and the effect of uncertainties renders this decision making process very cumbersome. Uncertainties derive from the complex phenomena that govern material degradation, unknown factors concerning the building process, the gap between design hypotheses and real conditions, from cost evaluations and from the definition of performance measures and corresponding limit states with respect to the conditions that in the reality render the infrastructure unusable or unsafe. Many practical procedures already in use by infrastructure owners and state agencies for the definition of performance indices and strategies are based on heuristics"	" these procedures have revealed to be effective in the management of an infrastructure containing a large number of homogeneous critical structures (e.g. bridges) essentially to the aim of prioritizing interventions. However, many recently proposed approaches are based on a more scientific background and take advantage of algorithmic procedures derived from the context of mathematical optimization and from the control theory. The paper is aimed at discussing some of the relevant problems arising from the conception, design and installation of a monitoring system able to perform a permanent """"health monitoring"""" function and to provide the information needed to reduce the effect of the uncertainties in view of the application of policy selection procedures for infrastructure management. After the type of monitoring has been selected the different components of the system shall be properly designed. For designing a sensory system, the scope of monitoring i.e. the physical parameters that shall be taken under control and the phenomena that need to be traced, shall be clearly understood. The type and number of sensors, their characteristics and their locations are strictly dependent on the above considerations and will greatly affect the economy and durability of the system. The physical quantities that may be measured include mechanical (strains, displacements, etc.) chemical, thermal quantities, as well as environmental (wind or wave characteristics, etc.) or loading (weight-in-motion). To design a sensory system able to perform economically, redundancy of measurements shall be reduced to a minimum. This requires a careful study of the features of the structural response that are to be extracted from the measurements. It has to be recalled that the cost of the data carriers and data loggers depends on the number of sensors and that, in a continuous monitoring system, an excessive number of sensors dramatically increases the amount of data to be processed. Maintainability of a sensory system may represent a big issue. To date, we have no information on the expected life of many of current sensor technologies compared to the expected duration of monitoring. In view of a continuous monitoring extended over the entire operational life of the structure, the problem of updating the technology of the sensory system shall be considered. Accessibility to critical components of the system shall always be ensured. It should be pointed out that present experience demonstrates that sensors have been continuously used on real structures for more than ten years without encountering significant problems. However there is no clear evidence that the systems will continue to operate for the expected life of the structure, i.e. for the next 50 or 100 years. Reliability of sensors, data carriers and data loggers for the long periods of observation expected for as continuous monitoring is also very important to minimize the down times and the consequent loss of data. The possibility of measurement failures shall also be considered. Flexibility in the sensory system means that the possibility of reconfiguring the sensor network during the operational life of the system shall also be appropriately considered. Flexibility can be obtained through a careful study of the data carrier/data logger subsystems. For large systems the identification of sub-networks, the use of conventional or wireless platforms, of distributed data acquisition modules and web-based applications shall also be considered. In designing the data management subsystem for a continuous monitoring solution, the following issues are very important. The system shall be able to form and render easily accessible the time series of the readings of each instrument in the system. These time series shall be always referable to unique time origins, processed for eliminating errors and filling the gaps due to temporary malfunctioning of some subsystem or instrument and for filtering out the effects of the phenomena that will not be considered in the subsequent processing. Data analysis and interpretation is the subsystem that is responsible for feature extraction and damage identification. Relatively extensive experiments and practical applications have been performed by using model-based techniques associated with static and dynamic monitoring. Non-model-based techniques, especially if applied to continuous static monitoring, have been mainly the subject of research studies and it has to be stated that, for the time being, there is no clear evidence from real experiences that damage detection and identification is a reliable outcome of their application. Sensory systems are also discussed in the paper, because current and near-future technologies provide a wide range of new possibility for the monitoring of structures.

Known as the JMA non-hydrostatic model variational data assimilation (JNoVA) system, it mainly functions as a four-dimensional variational data assimilation system, although it has an option to be used as a three-dimensional system. The set of control variables consists of initial conditions of unbalanced horizontal winds, large-scale components of potential temperature and surface pressure, unbalanced temperature and pseudo relative humidity. In the control variable transformation, hydrostatic balance and geostrophic balance are considered explicitly and the effect of the surface friction is also considered implicitly. When calculating the background-error covariances by the NMC method, a low-pass filter is introduced to remove noise in potential temperature and surface pressure that degrades the quality of the balanced winds. The cut-off wavelength of the low-pass filter is set to 300 km, which is the scale at which the model's kinetic energy spectrum transits to the shallower slope characterizing mesoscale motions.

In wind engineering, the possible extreme wind velocities constitute the basic targets in risk evaluations. In practice, lower extremes are significant for low energy generation possibilities and for power-cut risks, depending on the turbine type. However, upper extremes endanger the stability of the wind turbines. Additionally, the maxima of wind velocity variations have fundamental importance in engineering structural designs. Besides, from the meteorological point of view, maximum wind velocities directly relate to storms and thunderstorms.

This paper has two main objectives. The first is to present experimental data from diffusion flames in crosswinds to elucidate the relative importance of parameters that affect their carbon conversion efficiency (?). Drawing on these data, the second objective is to develop empirical models to estimate the efficiency of flares. Physical parameters shown to be important are fuel type, wind speed (U?), exit velocity (Vj), stack outside diameter (do), fraction of inert diluent in the fuel stream, and the specific energy content of the fuel mixture (expressed here as the lower heating value, LHVmass). Experiments revealed that increasing the amount of diluent in the fuel has a profound effect on inefficiency (1 - ?) in that reduced energy density flames become much more susceptible to the effects of the crosswind. A model was developed to correlate experimental data spanning 2 m/s ? U? ? 17 m/s, 0.5 m/s ? Vj 4 m/s, 12.2 mm ? do ? 49.8 mm with fuel dilutions using CO2 or N2 of up to 80% (by volume).

Given that data from natural-gas- and propane- or ethane-based flares did not follow a single correlation, coupled with the fact that the natural gas correlation could be slightly improved with d1/2o suggests that there may be different underlying mechanisms that lead to the inefficiencies for these fuels that need further exploration."""

A useful parameterisation of breaking strength is the energy dissipation rate per length of breaking front, normalised by the fifth power of the wave speed, gravity and water density. The strength parameter b appears as a proportionality constant. We reprocessed the data from the hydrofoil-induced, continuous wave breaking experiments of Duncan. This yields a consistent behaviour for the parameter b that correlates strongly with increasing wave steepness. In addition, values of b can be derived from the freely-propagating breaking wave data of Rapp and Melville that also increases systematically with wave steepness. Also, our recent measurements of smallscale, wind-forced laboratory waves provided dissipation rates that are consistent with measurements obtained at much larger scales in the absence of wind. For the case of short wind-forced waves, the direct input from the wind must also be included. Our analyses show that: The threshold wave steepness for transition between incipient and spilling breaking is very similar for a variety of wave conditions. Significantly higher dissipation rates due to wave breaking are observed for quasi-steady breaking waves generated by subsurface obstacles compared with freely-propagating waves. The dissipation rates of short wind waves are comparable with those of larger-scale, freely-propagating wave packets in the absence of wind. Consistent values of the dissipation per unit crest length coefficient b can be derived for all cases as a function of wave steepness."""

The monetary value of each state's incentives to purchasers of solar water, wind energy, or photovoltaic cell systems is calculated to compare state programmes. While the value of the incentives varies dramatically, the amounts appear unrelated to state energy and non-energy characteristics. The variations in state commitments and their independence from state energy conditions raise several policy questions that need to be addressed as the states assume the major role in renewable energy commercialization. © 1983."""

It is proposed that these improved criteria may replace the heretofore used discrete gust concept. The improved criteria consist of a rational-probability analysis backed up by a design envelope analysis. Both of these analyses are related to the strength level of a previously successful commercial transport and employ power spectral density techniques to establish design values. In conjunction with the rational-probability analysis, an acceptable failure probability is specified, and, for the design envelope analysis, a design limit gust velocity is established. Finally, the turbulence field parameters that may be used for design calculations on new aircraft are specified."""
