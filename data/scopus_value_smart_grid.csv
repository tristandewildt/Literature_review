The new quasi-real-time VVO technique optimizes distribution network using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data of each quasi-real-time stage. As this VVO performs automatically and online, it is necessary for VVCCs to undergo maintenance without disturbing VVO performance. Moreover, the lost benefits that could be gained by online VVO have to be minimized. Hence, this paper proposes an AMI-based VVO consisting of a VVO engine and a maintenance scheduling engine (MSE) that operate in tandem to optimize distribution network and find the optimal maintenance scheduling of different VVCCs. To test the accuracy and the applicability of the proposed solution, a 33-node distribution feeder is employed. Furthermore, five different maintenance scenarios are investigated to check the proposed VVO performance. The results prove that the integration of VVO with MSE could be a reliable approach that can solve maintenance scheduling of VVCCs without interrupting and/or resetting VVO. © 2003-2010 IEEE."""

Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) support this protocol and their recent deployment in substation automation systems (SAS) raises two questions. The first issue has to do with the traffic performance in an SAS and its scalability for fault management. It is vital to understand beforehand whether SAS traffic withstands extreme events, such as blackout situations, as is often claimed by their manufacturers. As our experience with these devices remains small, we look to simulating their behavior under varying SAS conditions. A second concern relates to the security of automation networks. There is a need to evaluate the reliability of SAS critical elements. Threats as diverse as terrorist and cyber attacks are feared [1]. Many countries are putting in place new regulations to combat such harmful actions. The IEC 61850 standard does not guaranty security, as this has been left as part of the scope of a different standard, namely, the IEC 62531 [6] [4]. The latter digitally signs the Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messages carrying sampled measured values (SMV). Nonetheless, many devices on the market do not yet support IEC 62531. Additional security mechanisms include the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These monitor and analyze network traffic in an attempt to detect anomalous and unwanted traffic. Some of these operate by capturing automation traffic and comparing it to known traffic profiles. A threshold may for example, be established to report unusual traffic patterns and to single them out as possible attack scenarios. These may then be more thoroughly investigated using specialized tools. This work provides a network level classification of GOOSE messages according to faults of an electricity energy system. More specifically, we will be looking at typical IEC 61850 response traffic that is generated as a result of a failure within an automation network. The measurements illustrate substation network traffic patterns for a problem such as a TriPhase or Phase-To-ground fault. The sampled data traffic is used for the modeling of traffic representing each of the power system faults. These models can then be used next to feed other specially devised simulators used for the analysis of the performance of an SAS. Furthermore, the established models may potentially play a considerable role in the identification of out-of-profile traffic that is likely to represent security threats. Finally, we expect the obtained models to help with the early diagnosis of this type of failures by simply observing their traffic signature. First, a brief introduction of the problem of traffic measurement is given. Section 2 introduces the reader to the terminology and describes the SAS scenario under evaluation.

In the DAM, a short-Term forward contract is made between the aggregator and an independent system operator (ISO). The contract specifies the contract size, which is the amount of regulation capacity provided by the aggregator for each hour of the next day. However, since the capacity of the aggregator is provided by many EVs instead of a single source, the challenge is how to efficiently aggregate the small and uncertain individual capacity and determine the optimal size of the forward contract. We consider two cases for the contract between the aggregator and the ISO. In the first case, the aggregator needs to ensure that the capacity provided by the EVs on the next day will meet the amount specified in the contract. In contrast, in the second case, the ISO allows an update of the contract size. A stochastic program is formulated to determine the contract size for both cases.

Electric vehicles (EVs), which are powered by clean energy, are adopted increasingly year by year. It is predictable that the huge charge load caused by high EV penetration will have a considerable impact on the reliability of the smart grid. Therefore, fair energy scheduling for EV charge and discharge is proposed in this paper. By using the vehicle-to-grid technology, the scheduler controls the electricity loads of EVs considering fairness in the residential distribution network. We propose contribution-based fairness, in which EVs with high contributions have high priorities to obtain charge energy. The contribution value is defined by both the charge/discharge energy and the timing of the action. EVs can achieve higher contribution values when discharging during the load peak hours. However, charging during this time will decrease the contribution values seriously. We formulate the fair energy scheduling problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process. The methodology of adaptive dynamic programming is employed to maximize the long-term fairness by processing online network training. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed EV energy scheduling is able to mitigate and flatten the peak load in the distribution network. Furthermore, contribution-based fairness achieves a fast recovery of EV batteries that have deeply discharged and guarantee fairness in the full charge time of all EVs."""

The objective of this work is to enhance the dynamic performance of islanded mode Micro grid in the presence of load disturbance using static VAR compensator (SVC). The contribution of this work is the implementation of PI fuzzy model reference learning controller (FMRLC) to SVC control loop. The control algorithm compensates for nonlinearity possessed by MG where fuzzy membership functions and implication imbedded in both controller and inverse model that achieve better presentation of both uncertainty and nonlinearity of the power system dynamics. Hence, MG keeps desired performance as required irrespective of the operating condition. In addition, learning capabilities of the proposed control algorithm compensates for grid parameter variation even with inadequate information about mathematical presentation of load dynamics. The reference model was designed to reject bus voltage disturbance, created by load and wind variation, with achievable desired performance. Accordingly, SVC with fuzzy controller was able to reject bus voltage disturbance by matching closely the reference model performance. Simulations were carried out to study the steady-state and transient performance of MG in islanded mode. The MG is composed of a PV bus supplied by wind turbine and induction generator, a PQ bus connected to nonlinear dynamic load and linear load, a single distribution line connecting the two buses, and SVC. The proposed control algorithm robustness was tested by providing load disturbance in different operating conditions and observing the system dynamic performance. The performance of the proposed controller is compared to a conventional PID controller using overshoot, transient oscillation, Integral-of-Time Multiplied Absolute Error (ITMAE), and integral square error (ISE) as performance parameters. Both ITMAE and ISE values for the proposed controller were much less than conventional PID controller. In addition, for the proposed controller, ITMAE values sustained stable increase while PID controller ITMAE values increased exponentially. These results indicates the progress achieved by proposed controller to enhance disturbance rejection with time due to learning process. © 2015 IEEE."""

Estimating battery lifespan, and optimising battery management to increase it, is difficult given the associated complex, multi-factor ageing process. In this paper we present a battery life prediction methodology tailored towards operational optimisation of battery management. The methodology is able to consider a multitude of dynamically changing cycling parameters. For lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells, the methodology has been tailored to consider five operational factors: charging and discharging currents, minimum and maximum cycling limits, and operating temperature. These are captured within four independent models, which are tuned using experimental battery data. Incorporation of dynamically changing factors is done using rainflow counting and discretisation. The resulting methodology is designed for solving optimal battery operation problems.

For a smart-phone that charges daily, our analysis finds that the battery life can be more than doubled if the maximum charging limit is chosen strategically. And for the battery supporting domestic solar, it is found that the impact of large daily cycling outweighs that of small more frequent cycles.

This leads to opportunities for different market parties to use the flexibility of EVs for various objectives that may be conflicting and result in a nonoptimal shifting of peak demands for the distribution grids. In this paper, we assess the financial impact of various EV charging strategies on distribution grids. We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads (from a network operators perspective) with a strategy to minimize charging costs (from the perspective of a commercial party). In a scenario with a high wind penetration in the system, the electricity prices are, for a significant part, determined by the instantaneous wind production. Therefore, we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and, consequently, on the resulting EV load and network impacts. We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value (NPV) of the investments costs and energy losses. We found that, in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices, the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25% higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized. The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration. The results strongly suggest that the situation where EVs are controlled with a strategy to minimize charging costs that does not take the distribution grids into account may not lead to an optimal situation when the entire electricity delivery system is regarded. © 2010-2012 IEEE."""

Many small-scale electricity suppliers (SESs) have recently entered the electricity market, which has been traditionally dominated by a few large-scale electricity suppliers. The emergence of SESs enables direct trading (DT) of electricity between SESs and end-users (EUs), without going through retailers, and promotes the possibility of improving the benefits to both parties. In this paper, the cooperation between SESs and EUs in DT is analyzed based on coalitional game theory. In particular, an electricity pricing scheme that achieves a fair division of revenue between SESs and EUs is analytically derived by using the asymptotic Shapley value. The asymptotic Shapley value is shown to be in the core of the coalitional game such that no group of SESs and EUs has an incentive to abandon the coalition, which implies the stable operation of DT for the proposed pricing scheme. Unlike the existing pricing schemes that typically require multiple stages of calculations and real time information about each participant, the electricity price for the proposed scheme can be determined instantaneously based on the number of participants in DT and statistical information about electricity supply and demand. Therefore, the proposed pricing scheme is suitable for practical implementation. Using computer simulations, the price of electricity for the proposed DT scheme is examined in various environments, and the numerical results validate the asymptotic analysis. Moreover, the revenues of the SESs and EUs are evaluated for various types of SESs and different numbers of participants in DT.

To produce electricity in the smart grid, many micro grids (MGs) may exploit various renewable energy resources. Because the production capacity of renewable resources cannot be controlled, the MGs often require the power plants to provide power for them. However, the power loss between each MG and the power plant is larger than that among the MGs. To alleviate this power loss, we propose a game theoretic coalition formulation strategy for the MGs dubbed GT-CFS. Our proposed GT-CFS allows the MGs (belonging to the same macro station (MS)) to autonomously cooperate and self-organize into a partition composed of disjoint MG coalitions. Also, GT-CFS enables the MGs, in a distributed manner, to decide whether they will remain in the coalitions or not upon environmental changes, e.g., the variation of the power demand of the MGs. Within every coalition, MGs coordinate the power transfer among themselves as well as with the MS, in a fashion to optimize a utility function, which captures the total losses over the power distribution lines. MGs in the same coalition will distribute the extra profits (i.e., payoff) produced from forming coalitions by their 'Shapley value.' Through computer simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GT-CFS reduces the average power loss per MG significantly in contrast with the conventional noncooperative approach. © 2013 IEEE."""

However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an L1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional L1 regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated.

In many cases, commercial or regulatory reasons may have led to a disappointingly low adoption of the technology. The notion of an energy storage device being different and unique in its capabilities has not been largely recognized within the regulatory framework. However, recent experience over the years 2008 to date has shown an accelerated interest in electrical energy storage and a rapid deployment of projects in marked contrast to the deployment over the previous decade. In many cases this increased deployment has been in advance of a true understanding of the value of these projects - indeed an important part of the justification of these projects is to better understand the benefits that such technology can bring. Many projects have been prompted by money provided either for technology innovation or for demonstration of either energy storage in particular or smart grid applications in general [2]. Nevertheless, there are also numerous projects where the technical or commercial reasons for applying energy storage provide sufficient justification [3], and growth is accelerating in much the same way that entrepreneurs have pushed the growth of wind and solar generation. Examples are given of projects in the power markets of Canada, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom, with a brief reference to the USA. The connection between the power market and current activity in electricity storage is explored. Emphasis on developing renewable and sustainable generation, as well as deployment of smart grid technology, is expected to strengthen the need for further deployment of electricity storage. Nevertheless, the present rate of deployment is believed to be very slow in comparison to the expected required level. Changes in the power systems planners' approach to sustainability lead to substantial changes in generation and system planning, and further changes caused by review of market procedures mean that a static approach to energy storage can rarely be adopted. Power system infrastructure is developing in a stepwise manner, more than in an incremental manner. Those considering an investment in storage must take into account new thinking on smart grids, demand side control and sustainable generation. Most deployment of storage appears to be in those areas which can be considered niches, usually island systems or small systems, especially where there is a need for ancillary services such as frequency regulation, peaking or reserve power, or mitigation of the effects of integrating renewable generation."""

The proposed concept is also novel in the sense that it deploys loads with different physical characteristics (or storage with different time constants) for the spot markets with different time scales and intervals. We show through a simulation a possible benefit and drawback of this LSE's risk minimization framework compared to cost minimization without risk management.

Moreover, in a future power system mostly consisting of distributed generators and renewable energy resources on which the disturbance has more impact, the analysis of disturbances by classifying and categorizing real-time frequency data is rather critical. Fortunately, wide area frequency data from a nation-wide frequency monitoring network (FNET) provides a means by which disturbances can be detected. However, so far none of strategies reported to date has good performance at classifying the disturbances although many of them are used currently in on-line analysis. The complex and irregular pattern characteristics of each kind of disturbance are the main reason. Artificial intelligence methods could be one of the solutions, but the large number of input values and an insufficient number of training examples has slowed the reduction of artificial intelligence methods to practice. Therefore, a mathematical model of common disturbances is proposed to generate a training database for artificial intelligence method and feature extraction by computing the wavelet coefficients, parameterizing the results and computer generating the data.

However, it is difficult for KEPCO to enter the gas and the heat selling market because other public companies are already dealing with them. In this situation, improving the business is possible when KEPCO develops a new business model and creates added value using Korean advanced Power IT combined with electricity. This study shows a new business model using Power IT, based on a survey targeting managers in KEPCO branch office and electrical engineers in the field.

As the devices supporting such applications are, in general, spread over a large part of the distribution network, one of the key issues to be considered is the communication, understood as: technology, equipment, protocols, standardization? Since equipment and functions are located at different hierarchical levels, they should be able to share information among them, no matter their relative position within the hierarchy. It is also important, in order to minimize restrictions, to have the possibility of using various technologies even to support the same application. One of the most important targets of distribution automation is to detect any fault in the network and to report on it as soon as the failure occurs and, at the same time, to provide accurate information about the location of the fault. Any improvement in the time required to know where the fault occurred will directly minimize the time to isolate the faulty feeder section and restore the network and service to those customers not fed through it. Fault location in a distribution network is much more difficult than in a transmission network"	 usually the protection functions and the fault location associated to them are at the substation where the distribution feeder has its origin. Due to the complex topology of downstream network, the calculated value is far from being as accurate as needed for a fast and reliable service restoration	" so any method that helps to locate the faults, as soon as possible, is welcomed. Fault indicators, based on various indication methods, have been a solution applied for long time, helping the Distribution System Operator to improve its response after the inception of a fault. This paper describes an application for the location of faults in underground urban distribution networks. It is build-in on a detection/communication device that, connected to the feeder at distribution centres, measures the current and, after the fault clearance by the feeder protection at the substation, triggers the communication system and sends a message indicating if it detected or not the fault. This information is addressed to a processing unit (may be the feeder protection or the substation central unit) that determine the real location of the failure. The communication is supported by a narrow band PLC built in modem that couples the signal to the ground shield of the power cable to reach the substation, directly o through other communication technologies as: optical fibre, GPRS, Broad band PLC? Once at the substation, and after processing all messages received from the detector involved in the fault, the fault location is calculated and sent to the control centre or used to initiate an automatism that sends commands to the switches along the feeder to restore the path to the electrical power, keeping the line ready to be powered by the recloser at the feeder protection."""

However, these networks and their services are not optimized with the requirements for this support in mind. A critical aspect is the need for several hours of backup power availability, something not usually required during AC grid outages resulting from other technical reasons. The availability of the maximum possible number of parallel emergency and voice calls during a disaster is ensured when the Operation & Maintenance Center reconfigures the network in accordance with a pre-defined emergency plan via a smart SW package. This also guarantees minimized power consumption by the basestations. The nature of the actual threat determines how the network has to be configured. Features such as prioritization of services and shut-down of hardware resources are part of this SW package and run automatically according to the pre-defined boundary conditions. The adaptation of HW-resources to the traffic situation can reduce the required battery backup capacity up to 30% in comparison to normal operation and for a given time period which has to be bridged. In combination with new battery technologies like Li-Polymer, which promise high energy densities, smaller and lighter battery backup devices can be realized in the future. Higher integration of digital components and advancements in power amplifier technology will yield a further reduction in basestation power consumption by up to 40% in the next two to three years, more or less independently of the mobile communication standard.
