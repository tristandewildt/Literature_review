Therefore, the future societies will be subject to creative development and wide-ranging transformation to optimize their energy consumption. The SG can integrate an assorted set of electricity resources, containing large power plants as well as distributed renewable energy resources, electric energy storage, demand response, and electric vehicles. In line with many visions for the SG, consumers will play a more ‘active’ role in the future energy systems. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure customers’ acceptance to successfully build a SG.

Despite the development and improvement of alternative energy technologies, there is still a large gap between the capability of renewable energy systems to capture and reliably supply power, and the ever-increasing global energy demand requirements. Therefore, until technological innovations facilitate sufficient energy generation through alternative fuels, other means of sustaining crude oil production, such as Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) methods, must be systematically explored. Beyond increasing production of conventional oil, IOR methods can effectively facilitate the extraction of oil from unconventional reservoirs, such as heavy oil fields. This capability is of high strategic importance due to the considerably large size of global heavy oil reserves. There are several IOR technologies available, but each of them is suitable only for certain oil field types. The aim of this paper is to illustrate an alternative, low-cost, quick screening method which is competitive to more technically laborious and costly methods for selecting the most suitable technology for a given heavy oil extraction project, using a limited dataset. A two-stage technology screening method is hereby proposed: the first stage is based on previous project literature data evaluation, and the second stage is based on simple empirical oil production correlation methods (such as the Marx & Langenheim model) coupled with Ingen's RAVE (Risk and Value Engineering) and Schlumberger's PIPESIM software applications.

This paper uses discounted cash flow analysis and real options analysis to value hybrid NG-RE systems in distributed applications, focusing on residential and commercial projects assumed to be located in the states of New York and Texas. Technology performance and operational risk profiles are modeled at the hourly level to capture variable RE output and NG prices are modeled stochastically as geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes to capture NG price uncertainty. The findings consistently suggest that NG-RE hybrid distributed systems are more favorable investments in the applications studied relative to their single-technology alternatives when incentives for renewables are available. In some cases, NG-only systems are the favorable investments.

Method: The phantom, including the contrast agent, was used in all experiments. The amounts of iodine in the contrast agent were 30, 15, 7.5, and 0.75 g/100 mL. Two images with different energy values were scanned and captured using dual-source computed tomography (80 and 140 kV). To obtain a fused image, 2 groups of images were processed using single-energy spectrum imaging technology. The Pinnacle planning system was used to measure the computed tomography values of the contrast agent and the surrounding phantom tissue. The difference between radiotherapy treatment planning based on 80 kV, 140 kV, and energy spectrum image was analyzed. Results: For the image with high iodine concentration, the quality of the energy spectrum-fused image was the highest, followed by that of the 140-kV image. That of the 80-kV image was the worst. The difference in the radiotherapy treatment results among the 3 models was significant. When the concentration of iodine was 30 g/100 mL and the distance from the contrast agent at the dose measurement point was 1 cm, the deviation values (P) were 5.95% and 2.20% when image treatment planning was based on 80 and 140 kV, respectively. When the concentration of iodine was 15 g/100 mL, deviation values (P) were ?2.64% and ?1.69%.

To meet more stringent emission targets, it is essential to reduce the emissions of these plants to an even lower level. Co-firing gasified biomass with natural gas (NG) reduces the plant emissions while allowing continued use of existing assets. If CO2 capture and storage are also applied, negative emissions may result which could provide additional CO2 credits to reduce the overall cost of decarbonising electricity generation. This paper investigates the impact of biomass gas quantity and quality on the performance and economics of a 547 MWe NGCC plant retrofitted with biomass gas co-firing. The analysis considers co-firing with and without CO2 capture. Three co-firing levels (5%, 20%, 40%) and three biomass gasification technologies (atmospheric air-blown gasification, pressurized oxygen-blown gasification and atmospheric indirectly heated gasification) are evaluated. Compared to the baseline NGCC power plant, at low co-firing levels, the type of gasification technology does not significantly affect the overall thermal efficiency, CO2 emission intensity or cost of electricity (COE). However, at higher levels of co-firing, the overall thermal efficiency increases by up to 2.5% LHV for the atmospheric air-blown gasifier but decreases by about 0.4% LHV for the pressurized oxygen-blown gasification and 2.5% for atmospheric indirectly heated gasification technologies. The CO2 emission intensity also changes by up to 0.16-0.18 t/MWh at co-firing levels of 40% for all three gasification technologies, while the COE increases by 0.12-0.18 $/MWh. The analysis also shows that the increase in the fuel flow rate is more significant for BGs with lower heating values. The increase in the fuel flow rate can increase the topping cycle efficiency but requires more modifications to the gas turbine. Thus, co-firing BGs with lower heating value might be less suited to retrofit scenarios. By applying capture to co-firing plants, negative emissions are achieved at medium and high co-firing levels with 7-18% increase in the cost of electricity relative to NGCC with capture. An evaluation of the effect of incentive schemes shows that relatively modest incentives (carbon price &gt"	 27 $/t CO2 and REC &gt	 10 $/MWh or combination of both at lower levels) are required to make co-firing cost competitive, while higher incentives are required for co-firing coupled with capture (carbon price &gt	 46 $/t CO2 and REC &gt	" 78 $/MWh or combination of both at lower levels). As the co-firing level increases, lower incentives are needed to achieve economic feasibility. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."""

The use of organic waste, which has a significant place among renewable energy resources, gains importance in terms of environment and energy optimization in sustainable development models. One of the renewable energy resources is biogas. In the countries where biogas technology is common, energy is produced by processing all kinds of organic waste in the biogas production facilities. Besides energy production, land, water, and air pollution caused by the waste is reduced to minimum. On the other hand, organic waste from the facilities is used as fertilizer in the vegetable production. In this research, biomass potential, which has an important and different place among renewable energy sources in terms of its existing potential and production technologies, is studied. Animal and vegetable-based waste and the equivalent energy potential of the biogas that can be produced out of these wastes have been identified. In this study, the average amount of dry biomass produced in Turkey in a year and the average heating value of the dry biomass have been calculated. In addition, suggestions have been made for taking advantage of the biomass potential efficiently and extensively. Turkey is rich in biomass and has adequate facilities and environmental conditions in terms of the development of this resource. In order to reduce the dependence of Turkey on foreign energy, transition to energy forestry and energy agriculture, development of obtaining biofuel from them and wastes, and biogas obtained from fertilizers, waste and garbage are required to be given importance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."""

The continuous demand of plastics caused the plastic wastes accumulation in the landfill consumed a lot of spaces that contributed to the environmental problem. The rising in plastics demand led to the depletion of petroleum as part of non-renewable fossil fuel since plastics were the petroleum-based material. Some alternatives that have been developed to manage plastic wastes were recycling and energy recovery method. However, there were some drawbacks of the recycling method as it required high labor cost for the separation process and caused water contamination that reduced the process sustainability. Due to these drawbacks, the researchers have diverted their attentions to the energy recovery method to compensate the high energy demand.

The films, realized through the layer-by-layer E-ALD electrochemical technique, reveal variable phase composition as a function of the applied E-ALD sequence. In particular, by increasing the Zn cycles per Cu cycle from 1:1 to 9:1, the number of detected phases changes from 3 to 2.

The variable phase composition parallels apparent changes in the sample morphology. In all samples, a sulphide thin film is covered by a net of elongated nanostructures, the length of which decreases with increasing the number of Zn cycles per Cu cycle. All these evidences are interpreted as due to the operating electrochemical route during the synthesis and confirm the lack of miscibility between Cu2S and ZnS, thermodynamically relevant after the E-ALD has stopped.

Not all drivers respond well to the same type of feedback. Research has shown that different drivers are attracted to different types of information and feedback. The goal of this paper is to explore which different driver segments with specific psychographic characteristics can be distinguished, how these characteristics can be used in the development of an ecodriving support system and whether tailoring eco-driving feedback technology to these different driver segments will lead to increased acceptance and thus effectiveness of the eco feedback technology. The driver segments are based on the value orientation theory and learning orientation theory. Different possibilities for feedback were tested in an exploratory study in a driving simulator. An explorative study was selected since the choice of the display (how and when the information is presented) may have a strong impact on the results. This makes testing of the selected driver segments very difficult. The results of the study nevertheless suggest that adapting the display to a driver segment showed an increase in acceptance in certain cases. The results showed small differences for ratings on acceptation, ease of use, favouritism and a lower general rating between matched (e.g., learning display with learning oriented drivers) and mismatched displays (e.g., learning display with performance oriented drivers). Using a display that gives historical feedback and incorporates learning elements suggested a non-verifiable increase in acceptance for learning oriented drivers. However historical feedback and learning elements may be less effective for performance oriented drivers, who may need comparative feedback and game elements to improve energy conserving driving behaviour. © 2015."""

We also assess energy storage technologies versus NGCC-CCS as backup options for IRES. Here, for base case assumptions NGCC-CCS with an LCOE of 90 €<inf>2012</inf>/MWh in 2040 is more costly than pumped hydro storage (PHS) or compressed air and energy storage (CAES) with LCOEs of 57 and 88 €<inf>2012</inf>/MWh, respectively. Projected costs for battery backup are 78, 149, and 321 €<inf>2012</inf>/MWh for Zn-Br, ZEBRA, and Li-ion battery systems, respectively. Finally, we compare four stylised low-carbon systems on a common basis (including all ancillary costs for IRES). In the 2040 base case, the system employing only NGCC-CCS has the lowest LCOE and lowest cost of CO<inf>2</inf> avoided with CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of 45 kg/MWh. A zero CO<inf>2</inf> emission system with IRES plus PHS as backup is 42% more expensive in terms of LCOE, and 13% more costly than a system with IRES plus NGCC-CCS backup with emissions of 23 kg CO<inf>2</inf>/MWh.

However, there are few studies on the self-propelled ability of the nozzle, and there is no model for the calculation of the self-propelled force. This paper developed a convenient model to calculate the self-propelled force and defined a factor to represent the self-propelled ability of the nozzle.

To achieve a stronger self-propelled ability, we investigated the effects of the number, angle, and diameter of the orifices on its self-propelled ability. The results show that the forward orifices exert a negative effect on the self-propelled ability, whereas their angles present a positive effect. With an optimal angle, the backward orifices primarily generate the self-propelled force. Although an enlarged orifice diameter can improve the performance of the nozzle, it still has an optimal value for the limitation of flow rate and jet pressure.

Five balanced K-edge filters including Molybdenum, Cerium, Dysprosium, Erbium, and Tungsten were used separately proximal to the X-ray tube. For each sinogram bin, measured filtered vector can be defined as a product of a transmission matrix, which is determined by the filters and is independent of the imaging object, and energy-binned intensity vector.

For each energy bin defined by two consecutive K-edges, a synthesized energy-binned attenuation image was obtained using filtered back-projection reconstruction. The reconstructed attenuation coefficients for each rod obtained from the experiment was in good agreement with the corresponding simulated results. Furthermore, the reconstructed attenuation coefficients for a given energy bin, agreed with National Institute of Standards and Technology reference values when beam hardening within the energy bin is small.

In order to produce high-quality recycling products, mono-fractional compositions of waste polymers are required. However, existing measurement technologies such as near infrared spectroscopy show limitations in the sorting of complex mixtures and different grades of polymers, especially when black plastics are involved. More recently invented technologies based on mid-infrared, Raman spectroscopy or laser-aided spectroscopy are still under development and expected to be rather expensive.A promising approach to put high sorting purities into practice is to label plastic resins with unique combinations of fluorescence markers (tracers). These are incorporated into virgin resins during the manufacturing process at the ppm (or sub ppm) concentration level, just large enough that the fluorescence emissions can be detected with sensitive instrumentation but neither affect the visual appearance nor the mechanical properties of the polymers.

This paper aims at providing an overview of the main activities performed in the system analysis working group of the H2-IGCC project. These activities included the modeling and integration of different plant components to establish a baseline IGCC configuration, adjustments and modifications of the baseline configuration to reach the selected IGCC configuration, performance analysis of the selected plant, performing techno-economic assessments and finally benchmarking with competing fossil-based power technologies. In this regard, an extensive literature survey was performed, validated models (components and sub-systems) were used, and inputs from industrial partners were incorporated into the models. Accordingly, different plant components have been integrated considering the practical operation of the plant. Moreover, realistic assumptions have been made to reach realistic techno-economic evaluations. The presented results show that the efficiency of the IGCC plant with CO2capture is 35.7% (lower heating value basis).

Several solutions have been proposed in the last years regarding energy and materials recovery from sewage sludge. Current technological solutions have relevant limits as dewatered sewage sludge is characterized by a high water content (70-75% by weight), even if mechanically treated. A Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) with good thermal characteristics in terms of Lower Heating Value (LHV) can be obtained if dewatered sludge is further processed, for example by a thermal drying stage. Sewage sludge thermal drying is not sustainable if the power is fed by primary energy sources, but can be appealing if waste heat, recovered from other processes, is used. A suitable integration can be realized between a WWTP and a waste-to-energy (WTE) power plant through the recovery of WTE waste heat as energy source for sewage sludge drying. In this paper, the properties of sewage sludge from three different WWTPs are studied. On the basis of the results obtained, a facility for the integration of sewage sludge drying within a WTE power plant is developed.

The challenges arising from this paradigm change are currently most obvious in the area of electric power supply. However, it affects the entire energy system, albeit with different effects. Within the energy system, various independent grids fulfill the function to transport and distribute energy or energy carriers in order to address spatially different energy supply and demand situations. Temporal variations are currently addressed by just-in-time production of the required energy form. However, renewable energy sources generally supply their energy independently from any specific energy demand. Their contribution to the overall energy system is expected to increase significantly. Energy storage technologies also represent an option to compensate for a temporal difference in energy supply and demand. Energy storage systems have the ability for a controlled take-up of a certain amount of energy, storing this energy within a storage media on a relevant timescale and a controlled redispatch of the energy after a certain time delay. Energy storage systems can also be constructed as process chains by combinations of unit operations, each covering different aspects of those functions. Large-scale mechanical storage options for electrical power are currently almost exclusively pumped hydro storage. These systems might be complemented in the future by compressed-air storage and maybe liquid-air facilities. There are several electrochemical storage technologies currently under investigation for their suitability as large scale electrical energy storage in various stages of research, development, and demonstration. Thermal energy storage technologies are based on a large variety of storage principles: Sensible heat, latent heat (based on phase transitions), adsorption/desorption processes or on chemical reactions. The latter can be a route to permanent and loss-free storage of heat. Chemical energy storage systems are based on the energy contained within the chemical bonds of the respective storage molecules. These storage molecules can act as energy carriers. Equally well, these compounds can enter various industrial value chains in energy-intensive industrial sectors and are therefore in direct economic competition with established (fossil) supply routes for these compounds. Water electrolysis, producing hydrogen and oxygen, is and will be the key technology for the foreseeable future. Hydrogen can be transformed by various processes to other energy carriers of interest. These transformations make the stored energy accessible by different sectors of the energy system and/or as raw materials for energy-intensive industrial processes. Some functions of energy storage systems can be taken over by industrial processes. Within the overall energy system, chemical energy storage technologies open up opportunities to link, connect and interweave the various energy streams and sectors. While chemical energy storage offers a route for a stronger integration of renewable energy outside the power sector, it also creates new opportunities for increased flexibility, novel synergies and additional optimization.

There are several challenges facing the design of mooring system of FOWTs, including installation costs, stability of light-weight minimalistic platforms, and shallow depths (50-300m). The extreme tension in mooring lines of a light displacement platform in shallow-water is dominated by snap loads. This is because light pre-tension requirements in the line may be insufficient to prevent the mooring lines from being exposed to wave motion induced slack and shock events. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of a semi-submersible based FOWT exposed to a 100-year storm condition, based on model test data and numerical simulations of well-known industry standard software. The data was obtained from a 1/50th-scale FOWT with the wind turbine modeled after the NREL 5MW wind turbine. The software, OrcaFlex, was used for numerical simulations of the mooring system. NREL's FAST software was coupled to OrcaFlex to obtain aerodynamic loads along with hydrodynamic load for FOWT analyses. The numerical simulation of the moored FOWT in a 3-hour storm was executed in both the frequency-domain and the time-domain to determine the dynamic behavior of the platform and mooring system, respectively. Snap - type impact events were observed in both test data and numerical simulation.

The vector autoregression (VAR) model was developed, through incorporating the impulse response analysis and variance decomposition, to analyze the dynamic relationship among the industrial structure (i.e., the amount of energy saving due to structural adjustment), efficiency (i.e., the amount of energy saving due to technological progress) and energy consumption per unit of GDP in Beijing. The VAR model was validated using the actual energy consumption per unit of GDP in Beijing from 2011 to 2013, and the error was found to be lower than 5%.

The majority of South Africa's electricity is supplied by coal-fired power stations. The amount of fine coal (-2 mm) generated at coal processing plants has increased, due mainly to mechanized mining methods. Fine coal retains more water, which lowers its heating value. Drying the coal is costly and it is difficult to achieve the required moisture content. Consequently, coal fines are often discarded. An estimated 8% of the total energy value of mined coal is lost1. Fluidized bed technology is often used to dry coal thermally, but this method is expensive and has an adverse environmental impact. The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of moisture from fine coal (<2 mm) in a fluidized bed operated with dry fluidizing air at moderate temperatures as the drying agent. The effects of different air temperatures and relative humidity levels were investigated in a controlled environment. The study further investigated the influence of coal particle size on moisture removal. The drying rate was found to increase with increasing temperature. The relative humidity of the drying air had a more pronounced effect on the drying rate, even at temperatures as low as 25°C.

Support for wave energy does not show a statistical correlation with environmental values, maybe a reflection of this technology’s nascent level of development.

MWe plant using an advanced two-stage gasification and plasma technology is undertaken. This plant can thermally treat waste feedstocks with different composition and heating value to produce electricity, steam and a vitrified product. The objective of the study is to analyse the environmental impacts of the process when fed with seven different feedstocks (including municipal solid waste, solid refuse fuel, reuse-derived fuel, wood biomass and commercial & industrial waste) and identify the process steps which contribute more to the environmental burden. A scenario analysis on key processes, such as oxygen production technology, metal recovery and the appropriate choice for the secondary market aggregate material, is performed. The influence of accounting for the biogenic carbon content in the waste from the calculations of the global warming potential is also shown. Results show that the treatment of the refuse-derived fuel has the lowest impact in terms of both global warming potential and acidification potential because of its high heating value. For all the other impact categories analysed, the two-stage gasification and plasma process shows a negative impact for all the waste streams considered, mainly due to the avoided burdens associated with the production of electricity from the plant. The plasma convertor, key characteristic of the thermal process investigated, although utilising electricity shows a relatively small contribution to the overall environmental impact of the plant.

Biomass is a world-recognized environmentally friendly renewable energy because of its lower contents of N and S element and the approximate zero net emissions of CO2. How to make full use of biomass energy has been an important direction of studies in the field of renewable energy. Biomass combustion is one of the most important technologies for large-scale efficient and clean utilization of biomass energy. The existing study on biomass combustion characteristics in China mostly focus on a kind of biomass, and little on different kinds of biomass. Thermal analysis curves (TGA-DTG-DTA) are commonly used in combustion characteristic analysis and dynamic analysis, but not in biomass combustion analysis. Therefore, this study investigated the combustion characteristics of biomass - agricultural residues (wheat straw, cotton straw, and cornstalk), forestry residues (sawdust), and industrial waste residues (sweet sorghum slag) at different heating rates (5, 10, 20, and 30°C/min) in air by thermo gravimetric analysis technology. Results showed that all the biomass combustion included four main phases: water evaporation stage, devolatilization and combustion stage, fixed carbon combustion stage, and burnout stage. The comprehensive combustion characteristic index S was ordered in wheat straw (XMJ) &gt"	 cotton stalk (MHJ) &gt	 sweet sorghum slag (GLZ) &gt	 cornstalk (YMJ) &gt	" sawdust (MX). The rise of heating rate could improve the combustion performance of biomass samples. Based on these results, a TGA-DTG-DTA method was proposed to determine the values of industrial analysis of samples. The weightlessness rate of A-B, B-C, and C-D was equal to moisture content, volatile content, fixed carbon content, respectively. The weightlessness rate of point D was the ash content of the sample. Thermal analysis curves under 20°C/min heating rate were recommended for industrial analysis. Meanwhile, a differential thermal analysis method was also proposed to determine calorific value of samples, which was the heat difference of peak area between RS (the heat discharged) and OP (the heat absorbed). The other heat-related curves could be obtained from TA-60WS data processing software built in the instrument. Overall, the best combustion performance could be obtained at the heating rate of 20°C/min for agricultural residues, 5°C/min for sawdust and 10°C/min for sorghum slag. The differential thermal analysis and thermal analysis curve expanded the application of thermogravimetric analysis technology in studies on biomass combustion characteristic.

However, the compromise is the loss of pulsatility due to continuous flow and retained percutaneous driveline leading to increased mortality and morbidity. Lack of pulsatility is implicated in increased gastrointestinal bleeding, aortic incompetence, and diastolic hypertension. We present a novel, wirelessly powered, ultra-compact, implantable physiologic controller capable of running a left ventricular assist device in a pulsatile mode with wireless power delivery. Methods: The schematic of our system was laid out on a circuit board to wirelessly receive power and run a left ventricular assist device with required safety and backup measures. We have embedded an antenna and wireless network for telemetry. Multiple signal processing steps and controlling algorithm were incorporated. The controller was tested in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results: The controller drove left ventricular assist devices continuously for 2 weeks in an in vitro setup and in vivo without any failure. Our controller is more power efficient than the current Food and Drug Administration-approved left ventricular assist device controllers. When used with electrocardiography synchronization, the controller allowed on-demand customization of operation with instantaneous flow and revolutions per minute changes, resulting in a pulsatile flow with adjustable pulse pressure. Conclusions: Our test results prove the system to be remarkably safe, accurate, and efficient.

The advantage of this method is that it provides a very high production rate up to 200 g/h and requires low energy consumption of 25 kW h/kg. The as-prepared MNPs were modified in situ in hexane, toluene, chloroform, and the solutions of polystyrene in toluene, in an inert atmosphere at room temperature in order to provide both the stability at ambient conditions and tunable surface properties. Hexane was an inert liquid for Fe and Ni MNPs. In the case of toluene the surface of as-prepared Fe or Ni MNPs acted as a catalyst for the condensation reaction of aromatic organic compounds forming irregular polycyclic structures. The treatment with toluene led to the deposition of carbon and formation of """"hair-like"""" ordered structures on the surface of the MNPs. Chloroform chemically interacted with Fe MNPs, forming FeCl2.

Emissions were estimated for both the approved initial operating design capacity of the facility (140,000. tonnes per year) and the maximum design capacity (400,000. tonnes per year). In general, calculated ecological hazard quotients (EHQs) and screening ratios (SRs) for receptors did not exceed the benchmark value (1.0).

This suggests that these exceedances reflect conservative assumptions applied in the risk assessment rather than actual potential risk.

The zonal isolation can be compromised due to the exposure of the well's main components (casing and cement) to the changes in the stress conditions. The changes in wellbore conditions can occur during the drilling, production, intervention, and decommissioning stages. Typically, conditions such as fluid pathway and high formation pressure are sufficient to lose zonal isolation. The fluid pathway can be a fissure, an induced crack in the cement sheath, a mud channel, a micro-microannulus, or changes in the cement matrix permeability. As a result of the oil industry technology developments, progresses, the advanced stress-modelling software and the availability of cement and rock properties property data have enabled to an improved understanding of the cement behavior under stress. Prevention of the loss of the hydraulic isolation provided by the primary cementing in the annulus can be assessed by predicting the mechanical failure of the cement sheath. Formation geo-mechanics is one of the main factors that help in designing a robust cement system for changing stresses. Furthermore, the consequence result of the cement sheath failure can be mitigated by the placement of placing a self-healing cement (SHC) system to maintain long-term zonal isolation. An interdisciplinary approach can be used to determine the following: • Understand the impact of the well plan, and fluid densities on well integrity, in addition to cementing best practices. • Characterize typical deepwater field formations, and establish limits for geo-mechanical values of each layer. • Identify critical factors and focus on the pay zones. • Understand potential issues and communication between the pay zones and the aquifers that are already previously confirmed. • Determine risk of zonal communication assessment, mitigation, and prevention measurement implementations Once the formation data is validated by the operator, the life cycle of the well is simulated and the risk of zonal isolation can be evaluated. The results of this assessment can help the operator choose between to take the approach of mitigation, prevention, or a combination of both.

Within this context, the Electric Vehicle constitutes the most promising alternative to conventional automobiles. However, one of the main challenges faced in the European Union is the development of a framework for the successful integration of large volumes of EVs into electrical power systems. Currently, a few sparsely distributed charging stations give service to a reduced number of EVs in those areas where the EV has initiated its introduction. Yet, as the number of EVs driving around rises smart demand management systems are required in order to avoid power allocation failures and to optimize the electricity flow across the grid. Additionally, there are other challenges in order to achieve such a smooth integration of the EV. In this sense, the introduction of new business models in the European electricity grid ecosystem is of paramount importance. Likewise, end-user acceptance of an electric based car technology represents an ultimate barrier for a widespread deployment of the EV (range anxiety). It's then necessary to define added-value services to enhance the EV driving experience and to support the mobility needs of its users. To that end, one must consider the knowledge of the realtime location of the EV user as a key requirement not only for the provision of added value location-based services but also for the development of new functionalities needed by the electricity grid operators and Electric Vehicle Aggregators such as smart real-time demand management and demand load prediction, amongst others. EVIC shall consider EV processes as originally defined by other reference European projects on this subject, and build additional services on these processes using GNSS-enabled enhancements.

The pellet produced by the pellet mill has many advantages, such as a high forming rate, high absorption rate, high calorific value, and low pollution. But because of absence of the torque modeling theory, the existing pelleting technology with high consumption, low productivity, and low service life has been the bottleneck of industrial development. By a mathematical analysis, FEA simulation, and testing research, this paper aimed at developing an accurate torque model in the pelleting process of rotated roll forming. First, based on the unit force analysis and generalized Hooke law, the pressure distribution model along the die hole was founded. Then based on the DPC model and rolling processes, the FEA model of the pelleting process was created, and the stress distribution in the compacted zone was analyzed. Next, based on the results of the FEA, the pressure distribution in the compacting zone was set as aquadratic curve, and the pressure models in the compacting zone and extruding zone were built. Finally, the torque model in the ring-die pelleting process was developed. The experiments were designed to verify the model created, and the wireless torque testing system was used to analysis the torque datum. In order to eliminate the effect of the bending moment of the belt in pelleting process, two strain foils were stuck symmetrically along the same circumference of a shaft. The experimental material was chicken feed and the main components included Zea mays, wheat, bean, fish flour, bone flour, salt, and so on. The structural parameters of the pellet mill were as follows: the ring die radius was 175 mm, the number of rollers was 2, the ring die width was 110 mm, the die hole radius was 1.75 mm, the die hole length L was 35 mm, the percentage of the die opening area was 0.3, the roller radius was 80 mm, and the linear velocity was 6.1 m/s. When the pellet mill was in stability conditions, the torque data were tested in real time, and the average value in one minute was obtained as the torque value. At the same time, the pellets produced in one minute were collected and weighed to compute the volume of production. The tested results were as follows: the torque was 1 518.5 N·m, the production rate was 5.1 t/h, and the constant PN0 was 3.79 kPa. Based on the tested datum, all the model constants were determined and the torque model was developed. In order to verify the torque model, calculations and experiments were carried out in three other different linear velocities. It was shown that the computing datum was very close to the experimental results and the calculation error was less than 3%.

The analysis is extended for STTRAM arrays by developing a computationally efficient RC compact model based thermal analyzer.

The natural gas hydrocarbon component consists of light straight chain hydrocarbons	" i.e., methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentane, etc. The inert component consists of nitrogen and water vapors whereas the sour component normally consists of carbon dioxide (CO 2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mercaptans, carbonyl sulfide, etc. The inert and sour components need to be removed to control the high heating value (HHV) of sales gas to a minimum of 930 BTU/SCF to meet the desired fuel gas specification and to keep sour gas content to a permissible limit in terms of health and safety regulations. Gas purification and treatment technologies are required for removing the inert and sour gas components. Normally, a gas containing more than 20 mol% inert and sour gases is termed a sub quality natural gas (SQNG). This type of gas is normally a lean gas with less heavy hydrocarbon components and has a lower heating value. The inert and sour components need to be removed to meet the sales gas and fuel gas specifications.

Low BTU or """"trash"""" gas monetization is required to meet the Kingdom's growing future gas demand, minimize crude oil burning and spare crude oil for export. The Saudi Aramco Gas Operation department is responsible for future gas development as well as the operation and optimization of the existing gas plants. Due to the growth in energy demand in the kingdom, Saudi Aramco is considering and evaluating whether it should develop low BTU gases. In this regard, Saudi Aramco has undertaken several initiatives and carried out many technical and commercial studies to develop and monetize gas resources. The low BTUs in various gas fields include different components and impose technical challenges for developing these fields. As a result, there are no common technical solutions for processing these gas sources. Low BTU gas sourness ranges between 10 and 35 mol%"	" and out of this, H2S is observed up to 25 mol% whereas the inert component - particularly nitrogen -Approaches about 40 mol% for some fields. Sour wet gas with a high nitrogen content heating value BTU ranges in between 500 to 700 BTU/SCF. Technical and commercial studies were conducted to evaluate different options for low BTU gas monetization. In this regard, different valorization options were evaluated in detail and included the following: •Power generation •Produce sales gas quality gas to send this to the sales gas network Different technologies were explored for power generation and gas processing to meet sales gas specifications. The technologies included acid gas removal, acid gas enrichment, sulfur recovery, and nitrogen and helium recovery.

Such a view arises partly from a recent change in emphasis in wastewater treatment technology, from simply oxidising the organic matter in the waste (i.e. removing the biological oxygen demand) to removing the nutrients - specifically nitrogen and phosphorus - which are the root cause of eutrophication of inland waterways and coastal zones. A growing need for nutrient removal greatly improves the prospects for using new algal ponds in wastewater treatment, since microalgae are particularly efficient in capturing and removing such nutrients. Using a spreadsheet model, four scenarios combining algae biomass production with the making of biodiesel, biogas and other products were assessed for two of Australia's largest wastewater treatment plants. The results showed that super critical water reactors and anaerobic digesters could be attractive pathway options, the latter providing significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions. Combining anaerobic digestion with oil extraction and the internal economies derived from cheap land and recycling of water and nutrients on-site could allow algal oil to be produced for less than US1 per litre. © 2013 IWA Publishing."""

Under these circumstances, residential electricity consumers can benefit from investments in domestic PV systems. Investment decisions in PV systems can be assessed with well-known discounted cash flows criteria such as the cost of energy and the net present value. These types of analyses either recommend abandoning the project or investing immediately. However, due to fast improvements in PV technologies, especially in the last few years, options to postpone investments in PV systems can be valuable. These options can be assessed with real options theory. This paper proposes a real options methodology for the assessment of domestic PV systems, considering the expected evolution of PV technologies and the option to delay investment. The methodology employs a normalization technique to illustrate, in a simple and intuitive manner, the convenience of the delay option. Two case studies based on real aggregated data for the UK are presented. The first case study illustrates the methodology, whereas the second is an extensive study meant to provide insights about investments in domestic PV systems in the UK. The results indicate the circumstances that drive and disincentivize investments in different PV technologies. Additionally, it is shown that the option to delay investment is a potential driver for investments in emerging organic-based PV technologies. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The use of real options theory can lead to the enhancement of the economic attractiveness of domestic photovoltaic (PV) projects. Additionally, it can facilitate the penetration of organic-based PV technologies for the generation of power in the domestic sector.

Therefore, during autonomous calibration, calibration paths which has low cost and low error values are preferable. To tackle the calibration problem on embedded wireless sensor networks, we present an energy efficient and minimum error calibration model, and also prove that due to random errors the problem turns into an NP-complete problem. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a formal proof is presented on the complexity of an iterative calibration based problem when random errors are present in the measurements.

Fluctuating crude oil prices and changing fuel specifications are some of the driving factors to develop new technologies that could be used to convert polymeric lignin into low molecular weight lignin and or monomeric aromatic feedstocks to assist in the displacement of the current products associated with the conversion of a whole barrel of oil. We present an approach to produce these chemicals based on the selective breakdown of lignin during ionic liquid pretreatment. Results: The lignin breakdown products generated are found to be dependent on the starting biomass, and significant levels were generated on dissolution at 160°C for 6 hrs. Guaiacol was produced on dissolution of biomass and technical lignins. Vanillin was produced on dissolution of kraft lignin and eucalytpus. Syringol and allyl guaiacol were the major products observed on dissolution of switchgrass and pine, respectively, whereas syringol and allyl syringol were obtained by dissolution of eucalyptus.

Conclusions: We have developed an ionic liquid based process that depolymerizes lignin and converts the low molecular weight lignin fractions into a variety of renewable chemicals from biomass.

According to the results of orthogonal experiment and considering the demand of practical production, the optimum conditions of enzymatic hydrolysis were as follows: the enzyme amount 0.025%, time 1.5h, temperature 35°C, pH value 4, and the juice yield under these optimum conditions was 81.6%. HHP had a very good protective effect on the color of Dajiao juice. The bactericidal effect was improved with the increase of the pressure level. After the treatment of HHP at 450 MPa for 10 min, the count of total bacteria was decreased to 10 cfu/mL by 90.25%. The aroma components in banana juice before and after HHP treatment were analyzed by combining solid phase micro extraction (SPME) with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method, investigating the changes of the aroma components. The data were subjected to analysis of variance using the SPSS1.7.3. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

This study evaluates the possibility of improving the prospects of increasing the clean and renewable energy mix. The new official energy plan for 2030, prepared for the Brazilian Government by the Energy Research Company (EPE1), forecasts a relative increase in thermal generation using natural gas, coal and nuclear energy. In contrast to this plan, this study considers wind generation as a complement to hydropower rather than fossil and nuclear energy. Previously, the analysis of seasonal complementarities in Brazil between average inflow hydraulic energy (ANAh) and average inflow wind energy (ANAw) has been generally focused on an intra-annual period. However, in this study, an initial effort is made to analyze the multiannual complementarities of the two sources. The wind technology learning curve in Brazil and worldwide was investigated, and the results show the potential of competitiveness of wind power compared with other sources, such as nuclear power, gas and coal. The replacement of thermal-based expansion by wind power was simulated by a comparative analysis of the net present value (NPV) of fuel, operation, maintenance and capital costs, including the potential learning time, of both scenarios. The NPV results indicate that the total costs of wind generation represent 57% of the total thermal costs, showing its potential attractiveness and that it facilitates the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases. Taking into account the population and the stabilization of energy demand in the 2040s, the possibility of meeting the energy demand of Brazil through renewable and sustainable energy sources, mainly hydropower and wind power, is demonstrated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."""

Several 6U SPCS units can target their energy streams to form a swath of energy to provide an increased aggregate level of power transfer to a particular craft as it flies though the swath. By separating the solar collection hardware from the consumption, solar cells can be replaced as part of a 6U SPCS replenishment schedule once degradation has rendered them unsuitable for use. The constellation will be arranged so that the orbital customer base is provided with access to power as-needed.

The reactor systems currently used for the chemical looping process include fluidized and moving bed reactors. Fluidized bed reactors are well developed for gaseous fuel combustion applications, while moving bed reactors operated with a counter-flow mode between the solid fuel and oxygen carriers would enhance combustion efficiency, and reduce the operating solid inventory of oxygen carriers. Gaseous fuels, including natural gas and syngas gasified from coal, could achieve complete fuel conversion and high CO2 yield for different combinations of oxygen carrier and reactor system. Gasification of solid fuels, including coal, petroleum coke and biomass in the fuel reactor, is a critical step that might reduce overall combustion efficiency. To improve solid fuel combustion and CO2 yield, modification of the reactor design or operational conditions are necessary for the combustion of solid fuels by a chemical looping process. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research."""

However combinations of high oil prices, improved extraction technologies and increasing energy depend have reignited interest oil shale industry. Oil shale is a rock that contains kerogen, an organic substance that breaks down when heated to yield combustible liquids, gases, and solids. The liquid product - crude shale oil can be transformed into a replacement for conventional crude. Shale oil is expensive to produce, and it has never been able to compete with conventional crude for very long time. However, crude prices have risen in the past few years and are expected to stay high which could make oil shale development practical. The quality of oil shale is either expressed by its heating value or the amount of shale oil that can derived from it liter/ton. Oil shale is considered commercial for use if its quality from 100-200 liter/ton. Processes for producing shale oil generally fall into one of two groups: mining followed by surface retorting and in-situ retorting.

In many cases, commercial or regulatory reasons may have led to a disappointingly low adoption of the technology. The notion of an energy storage device being different and unique in its capabilities has not been largely recognized within the regulatory framework. However, recent experience over the years 2008 to date has shown an accelerated interest in electrical energy storage and a rapid deployment of projects in marked contrast to the deployment over the previous decade. In many cases this increased deployment has been in advance of a true understanding of the value of these projects - indeed an important part of the justification of these projects is to better understand the benefits that such technology can bring. Many projects have been prompted by money provided either for technology innovation or for demonstration of either energy storage in particular or smart grid applications in general [2]. Nevertheless, there are also numerous projects where the technical or commercial reasons for applying energy storage provide sufficient justification [3], and growth is accelerating in much the same way that entrepreneurs have pushed the growth of wind and solar generation. Examples are given of projects in the power markets of Canada, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom, with a brief reference to the USA. The connection between the power market and current activity in electricity storage is explored. Emphasis on developing renewable and sustainable generation, as well as deployment of smart grid technology, is expected to strengthen the need for further deployment of electricity storage. Nevertheless, the present rate of deployment is believed to be very slow in comparison to the expected required level. Changes in the power systems planners' approach to sustainability lead to substantial changes in generation and system planning, and further changes caused by review of market procedures mean that a static approach to energy storage can rarely be adopted. Power system infrastructure is developing in a stepwise manner, more than in an incremental manner. Those considering an investment in storage must take into account new thinking on smart grids, demand side control and sustainable generation. Most deployment of storage appears to be in those areas which can be considered niches, usually island systems or small systems, especially where there is a need for ancillary services such as frequency regulation, peaking or reserve power, or mitigation of the effects of integrating renewable generation."""

We present an accurate model for the collisions between very intense linearly polarized laser beams, corresponding to relativistic parameters of the order of unity or greater, and electrons having energies up to 100 MeV. Our approach uses only one approximation, namely it neglects the radiative corrections. We consider the two cases in which the laser field polarization is either perpendicular or parallel to the plane defined by the directions of propagation of the laser beam and electron beam, and calculate accurately the properties of the ? and ? polarized scattered beams. The angle between the directions of the laser and electron beams, denoted by ? L, is allowed to have arbitrary values, so that the widely analyzed 180° and 90° geometries, in which the two beams collide, respectively, head on and perpendicularly, are particular cases. We prove that the polarization properties of the scattered beam depend on the angle ? L. By varying this angle, the polarization of the scattered beam can be varied between the two limit configurations in which the electromagnetic field of the scattered beam is ? or ? polarized with respect to the scattering plane. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental results published in literature. Our model shows that current technologies can be used to produce hard harmonics of the scattered radiations. These harmonics can have relatively high intensities comparable to the intensities of the first harmonics, and energies higher than 1 MeV.

The abatement cost per tonne emission reduction is calculated as the net present value (NPV) of the incremental cost between the fossil-based and the charcoal cookstoves divided by the total emissions reduction. The incremental cost refers to the difference between the generation costs per GJ from the different energy systems. The abatement costs of using charcoal cookstove instead of LPG stove and charcoal cookstove instead of kerosene cookstove amount to PhP10,725.64/t-CO 2e and PhP5,149.9085/t-CO 2e reduction, respectively. However, the use of charcoal cookstove instead of kerosene cookstove and LPG cookstove will result to displacement of 4.9485 t-CO 2e and 2.6676 t-CO 2e for a period of five years, respectively. The shift from the use of kerosene and LPG cookstoves to charcoal cookstove would result to large reduction of GHG emission to the atmosphere knowing that cooking particularly in the residential sector consumes large amount of energy.

It is also the first building in Turkey to receive the highest Platinum rating in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. A net-zero exergy building (NZEXB) is a building that has an annual sum of net-zero exergy transfer across the building-district boundary. This new target is made possible by lowered annual exergy consumption, (AEXC), and increased on-site production from a bundle of sustainable energy technologies. The modeled results of the building indicate that the reduced AEXC of 60 kW h/m 2 yr is met with on-site production of 62 kW h/m 2 yr. On-site production includes PV and building integrated PV, a micro-wind turbine, combined heat and power, GSHP, and solar collectors.

USDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer. Mass, energy, and exergy balances are analyzed for bio-oil production in a bench-scale fast pyrolysis system developed by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) for the processing of commodity crops to fuel intermediates. Because mass balance closure is difficult to achieve due, in part, to the system's small size and complexity a linear programming optimization model is developed to improve closure of elemental balances without losing the overall representation of the pyrolysis products. The model results provide an opportunity to analyze true energy and exergy balances for the system. While energy comparisons are based on heating values, exergy flows are computed using statistical relationships and other standard techniques. Comparisons were made for a variety of biomass feedstocks including energy crops and various byproducts of agriculture and bioenergy industry. The mass model allows for proper accounting of sources of mass loss and suggestions for improved system performance. Energy recovery and exergetic efficiency are compared for a variety of pyrolysis product utilization scenarios including use of biochar and noncondensable gases as heat sources. Exergetic efficiencies show high potential for energy utilization when all the pyrolysis product streams can be recycled to recuperate their internal energy.

Reviews are carried out on respective LCA studies published over the last six years. We use the classification of lignocellulosic biomass to define system boundaries, so that the comparison among LCA results can be thoroughly assessed based on identified system components. A basis for attributing environmental burden for different biomass feedstocks is also suggested. Despite the non-homogeneous systems, we conclude that second generation bioethanol performs better than fossil fuel at least for the two most studied impact categories, net energy output and global warming. For the latter category, carbon sequestration at the biomass generation stage can even consistently offset the GHG emissions from all parts of the life cycle chains at high ethanol percentage (?85%). The aspect of biogenic carbon and agrochemical input for energy crops and biomass residues, and the effect of removal of the latter from soil have not been treated consistently. In contrast, the exclusion of upstream chain of biomass waste feedstocks is observed in practice. The bioethanol conversion process is mostly based on simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation, characterized by high yield and low energy input. In this regard, the LCA results tend to under estimate the real impacts of the current technology. The choice of allocation methods strongly influences the final results, particularly when economic value is used as a reference. Substitution of avoided burden seems to be the most popular allocation method in practice, followed by partition based on mass, energy, and economic values. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve sustainable development, China has to consider how to promote energy efficiency to meet the demand of Chinese rapid economic growth, as the energy efficiency of China is relatively low. Meanwhile, the appeal of energy saving and emission reduction has been made by the Chinese central government. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the energy efficiency of industrial sector in China and to assess efficiency development probabilities. The framework of total factor energy efficiency index is adopted to determine the discrepancy of energy efficiency in Chinese industrial sector based on the provincial statistical data of industrial enterprises above designated size in 30 provinces from 2005 to 2009, with gross industrial output as the output value and energy consumption, average remaining balance of capital assets and average amount of working force as the input values. Besides, in considerate of the regional divide of China, namely eastern, central, and western, and economic development differences in each region, energy efficiency of each region is also analysed in this paper. The results show that there is room for China to improve its energy efficiency, especially western provinces which have large amount of energy input excess. Generally speaking, insufficient technological investment and fail of reaching best scale of manufacture are two factors preventing China from energy efficiency promotion.

Secondly, if renewable energies and combined heat and power are expanded further and energy productivity is enhanced, there is likely to be only a limited demand for CCS power plants, as a scenario analysis of CCS deployment in Germany shows.

The study analyzes the theoretical performance of each installation using different methodologies, and compares the actual generation yields against the original modeled data by the design consultants. Performance was evaluated with respect to local conditions for each installation such as orientation, tilt angle and shading. Modeling was carried out using approved industry techniques and software packages to investigate the effects of repositioning and upgrading to more efficient panels to ascertain if better solutions could have been implemented. The analysis has shown that the energy generation was generally in keeping with original predictions of the design consultants, providing some confidence in performance forecasting for this technology. A whole life (installation to decommissioning) net present value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) analysis of the PV installations was conducted, including future inverter replacement and re-roofing costs. This revealed that due to a larger than expected capital outlay (particularly for the inverter replacement), the systems did not produce a commercially attractive return on investment. The study also investigated the effect of applying the UK Feed in Tariff (FiT) - for which these systems were not originally eligible - which showed that a simple payback could be achieved within the 25 year system lifetime. The FiT therefore offsets some of the risk associated with roof mounted PV systems. The conclusion of the study is that the current PV installations on eight of the London Fire Brigade stations cannot be considered a viable financial investment without the use of a suitable subsidy, and even this does not provide a substantial rate of return due to the high initial capital outlay.

They are typically defined as wind, solar and bio-fuels. However, the most potential exists where the most is wasted. The author asserts this is the non-obvious home furnace or heating systems. One reason the home furnace is overlooked is some furnaces are advertised to have a 96 % efficiency. It is notable that prior to the last generation, the best residential furnaces were typically 80 % efficient. This meant that 20 % of the heat went up the chimney in the form of elevated temperature combustion products and water vapor. The step improvement to 96 % efficiency was obtained by increasing the heat recovery surface area with a secondary heat exchanger, which cooled the combustion products down close to space temperature and also condensed most of the vapor in the combustion products. The chimney was replaced with a clothes drier type vent to the side of the house. Thus, virtually all of the sensible heat and most of the latent heat in the combustion products was recovered. The result has been called a condensing furnace, which was commercialized in the mid 1980s. Chimney furnaces need the lower density of the elevated temperature combustion products to cause them to go up the stack by free convection. The cooled combustion products of a condensing furnace are not buoyant and thus require forced purging. This has been achieved in some furnaces by pulse combustion with tuned valves, or alternatively by a conventional combustion chamber and a motor driven fan to draw the products from the furnace. This near 100 % efficiency suggests there is very little room for improvement. However, thermodynamic students should recognize this is a 1 st law efficiency. It is the ratio of space heat delivered to the heat value or the amount of heat produced by burning the fuel. If the 2 nd law is considered it is recognized that heat must be transferred over a very large temperature difference between the combustion products and the space temperatures. This results in a large entropy production and wasteful irreversibility. It also means a lost opportunity to convert the high temperature heat mechanical power or electricity, that are highly refined forms of energy much more valuable than low temperature heat. An understanding of the 2 nd law is needed to explain why a 1 st law efficiency of over 100 % is possible. The explanation can be challenging. It should start with defining an ideal heating system, which would have no entropy production and thus no irreversibility. This means determining the minimum amount of fuel to produce the required space heat. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."""

Although clustering helps by improving the clock speed, reducing the energy consumption of the logic, and making the design simpler, it introduces extra overheads by way of inter-cluster communication. This communication happens over long global wires having high load capacitance which leads to delay in execution and significantly high energy consumption. Inter-cluster communication also introduces many short idle cycles, thereby significantly increasing the overall leakage energy consumption in the functional units. The trend towards miniaturization of devices (and associated reduction in threshold voltage) makes energy consumption in interconnects and functional units even worse, and limits the usability of clustered architectures in smaller technologies. However, technological advancements now permit the design of interconnects and functional units with varying performance and power modes. In this paper, we propose scheduling algorithms that aggregate the scheduling slack of instructions and communication slack of data values to exploit the low-power modes of functional units and interconnects. Finally, we present a synergistic combination of these algorithms that simultaneously saves energy in functional units and interconnects to improves the usability of clustered architectures by achieving better overall energy-performance trade-offs.

However when high-temperature physical phenomena occur beneath the molecular and atomic scales, the knowledge of quantum physics and quantum chemical-physics becomes essential. Therefore the most challenging topics in computational simulation probably can be identified as the chemical-physical models for a high-temperature gaseous medium. The thermal radiation is also associated with quantum transitions of molecular and electronic states. The radiative energy exchange is characterized by the mechanisms of emission, absorption, and scattering. In developing a simulation capability for nonequilibrium radiation, an efficient numerical procedure is equally important both for solving the radiative transfer equation and for generating the required optical data via the ab-initio approach. In computational simulation, the initial values and boundary conditions are paramount for physical fidelity. Precise information at the material interface of ablating environment requires more than just a balance of the fluxes across the interface but must also consider the boundary deformation. The foundation of this theoretic development shall be built on the eigenvalue structure of the governing equations which can be described by Reynolds transport theorem. Recent innovations for possible aerospace vehicle performance enhancement via an electromagnetic effect appear to be very attractive. The effectiveness of this mechanism is dependent strongly on the degree of ionization of the flow medium, the consecutive interactions of fluid dynamics and electrodynamics, as well as an externally applied magnetic field. Some verified research results in this area will be highlighted. An assessment of all these most recent advancements in nonequilibrium modeling of chemical kinetics, chemical-physics kinetics, ablation, radiative exchange, computational algorithms, and the aerodynamic-electromagnetic interaction are summarized and delineated. The critical basic research areas for physic-based hypersonic flow simulation should become self-evident through the present discussion.

This might lead to the assumption that energy efficiency can be taken for granted. There are, however, many issues to consider, particularly with the availability of fuel being so variable. Mills on sites without access to gas have to consider their technology very carefully if they plan to step up production. Coal cannot produce steam at as high a rate as gas, so speeds close to 1,700 mpm rather than 2,000 mpm are realistic. At Toscotec we believe, however, that with world-class runnability this can still put a mill in a strong position, by significantly reducing production costs. Our message is that with the right technology, you can still be competitive with energy sources with lower heating values. The Steel Yankee Dryer, combined with specific drying solutions in the hood and heat recovery system, is most certainly the way forward. There is also the issue of appropriate size for a tissue investment. Producers in the region are increasingly looking at technology which, while matching the sophistication of the biggest lines, is designed for a different output. Such lines, in addition to representing a smaller investment, might be more suitable to supply just the local population, without having to transport the tissue at great expense to other locations to use up the capacity. But to be competitive, these machines need to match their larger counterparts in energy efficiency. While on the subject of energy, we introduce a new member to the Toscotec Group: Milltech.

Methodology: The minimum value of the coefficient of head-resistance was accepted as a criterion of rational arrangement of tandem cylinders. Dependences of averaged coefficients of head-resistance and carrying capacity were established. On the basis of equations of motion of the two-phase environment the numerical simulation of flowing of tandem cylinders by the spatial stream of viscid liquid was fulfilled. Findings: The reason for tearing-off the laminar frontier layer from the surface of cylinder is the increase of pressure in diffuser part of stream. Vortexes that unstuck from the cylinder surface are unsteady structures reacting on the least changes of terms of flowing. Formation of these vortexes is accompanied by discrete displacement of points of tearing-off and oscillation of hydrodynamic forces. Therefore even at the fixed values of Reynolds numbers, position of tearing-off points change constantly. In terms of hydroseparator the influence of hydrody-namic terms of flowing of tandem cylinders on character of tearing-off of stream in the first approach it is possible to estimate using the results of research of their flowing around the spatial stream of viscid liquid. The analysis of the received results for realization of layerwise recleaning of grainy materials, providing the rise of efficiency of division and productivity of semicounterflow hydroseparator with minimum hydraulic resistance was given. The conducted experimental research confirms suitability of the proposed calculation methodology for the substantiation of stream structure of twophase environment in semicounterflow hydroseparator with layerwise recleaning and perspective of its application for classification and enriching of grainy materials. Originality: Compared to the spatial flowing of tandem cylinders, flowing of dividing elements in frame of semicounterflow hydroseparator is characterized by lowering of pressure in an external flow after the point of a minimum pressure and forming of zone of capture of viscid liquid by the slot of the dividing element. Practical value: One of the directions of improvement of quality of concentration products of mineral raw material is to rise the efficiency of hydraulic separation process by development of new methods and vehicles with the rational zone of division and low energy consumption, due to the fact that used for this purpose cylinder-conic hydrocyclones have low (37?56% according to Hancock) technological efficiency conditioned by a number of reasons.

There is no study, to the author's knowledge, on manipulating nutrient profiles through fractionation processing in bioethanol coproducts in ruminants. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of fractionation processing of a coproduct from bioethanol processing (wheat DDGS) on the metabolic characteristics of the proteins and to study the effects of fractionation processing on the magnitude of changes in chemical and nutrient supply to ruminants by comparing chemical and nutrient characterization, in situ rumen degradation kinetics, truly absorbed protein supply, and protein degraded balance among different fractions of coproduct of wheat DDGS. In this study, wheat DDGS was dry fractionationed into A, B, C, and D fractions according to particle size, gravity, and protein and fiber contents. The results showed that the fractionation processing changed wheat DDGS chemical and nutrient profiles. NDF and ADF increased from fraction A to D (NDF, from 330 to 424"	 ADF, from 135 to 175 g/kg DM). Subsequently, CP decreased (CP, from 499 to 363 g/kg DM), whereas soluble CP, NPN, and carbohydrate increased (SCP, from 247 to 304 g/kg CP	 NPN, from 476 to 943 g/kg SCP	 CHO, from 409 to 538 g/kg DM) from fraction A to D. The CNCPS protein and carbohydrate subfractions were also changed by the fractionation processing. Effective degradability of DM and CP and total digestible protein decreased from fraction A to D (EDDM, from 734 to 649	 EDCP, from 321 to 241	 TDP, from 442 to 312 g/kg DM). Total truly absorbed protein in the small intestine decreased from fraction A to D (DVE value, from 186 to 124 g/kg DM	 MP in NRC-2001, from 193 to 136 g/kg DM). Degraded protein balance decreased from wheat DDGS fractions A-D (DPB in the DVE/OEB system, from 245 to 161 g/kg DM	" DPB in NRC-2001, from 242 to 158 g/kg DM). The fractionation processing had a great impact on the chemical and nutrition profiles. Total truly digested and absorbed protein supply and degraded protein balance were decreased. The processing relatively optimized the protein degraded balance of the coproducts to dairy cattle. Compared with the original wheat DDGS (without fractionation), fractionation processing decreased truly absorbed protein supply of DVE and MP values. In conclusion, fractionation processing can be used to manipulate the nutrient supply and N-to-energy degradation synchronization ratio of coproducts from bioethanol processing. Among the fractions, fraction A was the best in terms of its highest truly absorbed protein DVE and MP values. Fractionation processing has great potential to fractionate a coproduct into a desired and optimal chemical and nutrient profile.

High thermal efficiency and low cost of electricity make it an attractive option in the era of growing energy demand. An almost seven fold density variation for coolant/moderator along the active height does not allow the use of constant density assumption for design calculations, as used for previous generations of reactors. The advancement in computer technology gives us the superior option of performing coupled analysis. Thermal hydraulics calculations of supercritical water systems present extra challenges as not many computational tools are available to perform that job. This paper introduces a new sub-channel code called Sub-channel Analysis Code of SCWR (SACoS) and its application in coupled analyses of High Performance Light Water Reactor (HPLWR). SACoS can compute the basic thermal hydraulic parameters needed for design studies of a supercritical water reactor. Multiple heat transfer and pressure drop correlations are incorporated in the code according to the flow regime. It has the additional capability of calculating the thermal hydraulic parameters of moderator flowing in water box and between fuel assemblies under co-current or counter current flow conditions.

The results were found to be in very good agreement. Significant difference between the results was seen when Doppler feedback effect was included in the coupled calculations. This difference is due to the use of different values of fuel temperature to include Doppler feedback in our and reference coupled systems.

Because the social returns to R&D investments are typically higher than the social returns to other types of investment, any new climate mitigation R&D that comes at the expense of other R&D investment may dampen the overall gains from induced technological change. Unfortunately, there has been little empirical work to guide modelers as to the potential magnitude of such crowding out effects. This paper considers both the private and social opportunity costs of climate R&D. Addressing private costs, we ask whether an increase in climate R&D represents new R&D spending, or whether some (or all) of the additional climate R&D comes at the expense of other R&D. Addressing social costs, we use patent citations to compare the social value of alternative energy research to other types of R&D that may be crowded out. Beginning at the industry level, we find no evidence of crowding out across sectors-that is, increases in energy R&D do not draw R&D resources away from sectors that do not perform R&D. Given this, we proceed with a detailed look at alternative energy R&D. Linking patent data and financial data by firm, we ask whether an increase in alternative energy patents leads to a decrease in other types of patenting activity. While we find that increases in alternative energy patents do result in fewer patents of other types, the evidence suggests that this is due to profit-maximizing changes in research effort, rather than financial constraints that limit the total amount of R&D possible. Finally, we use patent citation data to compare the social value of alternative energy patents to other patents by these firms. Alternative energy patents are cited more frequently, and by a wider range of other technologies, than other patents by these firms, suggesting that their social value is higher. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."""

According to the International Energy Agency (EIA), by 2035 global energy demand will increase by 53%. The EIA also mentions that Renewable Energy is projected to be the fastest growing source of energy over the next 25 years. Although fossil fuels will dominate the energy market, there is an urgent need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, which offers several benefits such as energy independence and cleaner energy. Renewable energy sources include wind, solar, biomass, hydro, and geothermal. Advantages of alternative energies are that they are renewable, better for the environment, and energy independent. To encourage the use of alternative energy sources in the United States, many States have introduced policies such as renewable portfolio standards that require an increased production of energy from alternative renewable energy sources. Biomass is a promising alternative energy source that can potentially replace coal in power plants, but several properties of biomass such as high moisture content, low heating value, fibrous nature, biomass handling and storage make it difficult to be used. This is where torrefaction comes into picture as a substitute for coal. Torrefaction is an important step in using biomass as fuel source. The actual process of torrefaction involves heating biomass to temperatures of 230-300oC in the absence of an oxidizing agent and under atmospheric pressure. The advantages of torrefaction are in the product. The product is a dried biomass that has a higher mass energy density, is hydrophobic, and is more uniform, in composition, compared to unprocessed biomass. Also, the grindability (ie, resistance to crushing) characteristics of torrefied biomass greatly improve and are comparable with coal and coke. Tests have been conducted on lab scale to evaluate the effect of torrefaction on several biomass feedstock properties including pine, willow, arundo, and bamboo. The effect of torrefaction on heating value, grindability, and hydrophobicity of biomass have will be discussed. © 2012 IEEE."""

Biorefinery is a concept of converting lignocellulosic biomass or grains (such as corn) to chemicals, materials and energy on which human civilization runs, replacing the need for petroleum, coal, natural gas, and other nonrenewable energy and chemical sources. Lignocellulosic biomass is renewable, that is plant synthesizes chemicals (by drawing energy from the sun and carbon dioxide) and water from the environment, while releasing oxygen.

This model includes costs from initial regional geologic evaluation through site characterization, permitting, injection/MVA operations, post-injection site care to final site closure and transfer to long-term stewardship. Differences in storage costs across different geologic formations are driven by two basic factors: injectivity which determines the number of injection wells drilled to accommodate a given rate of CO2 injection and the volume of CO2 to be sequestered which determines, per in-situ reservoir parameters, the areal extent of the plume and hence the Area of Review of a Class VI well permit. The AoR defines the areal extent of MVA activities which dominates costs during injection and post-injection operations. The basic framework for this model provides costs for compliance with various sections of EPA's Class VI regulation and Subpart RR of the GHG Reporting Program. Cost analysis at two levels is provided by this model: site specific where the modeler can enter their own reservoir and cost data and regional in the form of cost supply curves. A geologic and cost database was developed to support this model. Published analyses of storage cost to date have been very general, providing estimates for site characterization or overall costs but few details. While storage costs are a small percentage of overall CCS costs, they represent a significant investment. Getting to the point of injection operations will take tens of millions of dollars. Model results indicate that operation/post-closure MVA costs will represent some 70 percent of overall storage costs.

The main results are as follows: 1. the best location of the plasma addition region is near the intersection of the nose shock of the vehicle with the continuation of the cowl line, and slightly below that line. In that case, the shock generated by the heating is close to the shock that is a reflection of the vehicle nose shock off the imaginary solid surface-extension of the cowl. 2.

This was accomplished using theoretical equilibrium calculations and experimental absorption data for alkali solutions of 1, 2,3,4 and 5 weight %.

In the experimental setup, a 16% C0 2/balance air gas mixture was bubbled through an Erlenmeyer flask filled with an alkali solution. The gas exiting the flask was fed to a gas analyzer to record the % CO 2 in the exhaust gas stream. The % CO 2 absorbed was taken as the % CO 2 in the exhaust gas minus the % CO 2 in the feed. Theoretical calculations found that as the % alkali in solution increases, the solubility of CO 2 decreases.

This article uses the real options technique to find the economically desirable start-up dates for three carbon-free methods of generating electricity, nuclear, onshore wind, and offshore wind, when facing competition from electricity generated from natural gas. The fact that the same assessment method has been used for each of the three carbon-free options allows intercomparability of the results. Nuclear power is projected to become competitive with gas-based electricity in 2015, even when no benefit is claimed for its carbon-free properties. Using the same yardstick, unaided onshore wind power first becomes competitive with gas in 2032 and unaided offshore wind power in 2040. There is thus a wide disparity among the dates of competiveness for the three methods of generation considered. Judged on a level playing field for carbon-free technologies, nuclear power emerges as a much better investment than onshore wind, while onshore wind is better than offshore wind. The analysis provides an explanation for the significant number of utilities who have declared an interest in New Nuclear Build in the UK in the near future. It shows that these utilities can be expected to make money immediately after their plants start up, even if they are given no credit for the carbon-free nature of nuclear generation. By contrast, the economics of wind power look more problematic. Even given the current level of intervention, £40/MWh, equivalent to £90/t CO2 avoided, onshore wind farms are not expected to become competitive with gas generation for about 15 years. That timescale stretches to over 20 years if no intervention is made. The situation is worse for offshore wind farms, which do not become competitive until 2028 even when given twice the aid offered to onshore wind farms: £80/MWh, equivalent to £180/t CO2 avoided. Without this high level of support, offshore wind farms are not expected to become competitive with gas generation for nearly 30 years even when allowance is made for the improved technology associated with series build. While wind technology is likely eventually to become competitive with gas, the real options analysis suggests that it would require significant cost reductions for a major, early deployment of wind power to become justified. It would appear to be a particularly questionable use of resources to spend money developing offshore wind farms so far in advance of their likely cost-effectiveness. The real options analysis suggests that large-scale construction of offshore wind farms should be delayed until the late 2030s. © Authors 2011."""

Method: Utilising the MPT model (Matching Person and Technology) and the ValMO model (Values and Meaning in Human Occupations), a framework of understanding is proposed. Results: Main components are person, assistive device, and activity, connected by the person's expectations and experiences concerning the doability/doworthiness (possible to do/worth doing) of an activity, and the usability/useworthiness (possible to use/worth using) of an assistive device. Expectations may differ based on not only earlier experiences (habitus), but also situational and environmental variations, and result in differing experiences. In general, the purpose of an assistive device is to increase a person's repertoire of doable activities. For a person, this can be a function of the evaluation of possible gains, in terms of correlation between investments (in terms of time and energy), and the (expected) result of the activity. Conclusions: The only person able to estimate the useworthiness/usability of a device and the doworthiness/doability of an activity is the user her/himself, assessing the degree at which a specific assistive device enhances the value of an activity, in turn affecting the habitus of the (presumptive) user.

The risk analysis was carried out using the J-value method, which provides a common, objective scale by which human harm can be valued. The analysis assessed human mortality impacts arising from the construction of future plants over the 60-year period from 2010 to 2070 for the entire fuel chain. Despite the considerable uncertainties in current estimates, the analysis provides evidence of the worth of the J-value methodology, particularly in relation to its ability to take explicit account of loss of life expectancy in evaluating delayed health effects. Risks are delineated according to two dimensions: whether the risk is occupational or public, and whether the risk is immediate or delayed. Impacts are also assessed for major accidents. The results indicate that nuclear generally has the lowest impacts, while gas, onshore wind and offshore wind have indicative impacts that are about an order of magnitude greater, although the estimates for both wind technologies carry considerable uncertainty. Coal power was found to present high impacts compared with the other technologies, mainly as a result of pollution emissions, even though the potential harm from some emissions has not been included because the effects are not fully understood. Total nuclear impacts were found to be sensitive to assumptions regarding the use of collective dose and the assumptions which are then used to calculate impacts.

Aerobraking at Venus also provides additional science benefits through the measurement of upper atmospheric density (recovered from accelerometer data) and temperature values, especially near the terminator where temperature changes are abrupt and constant pressure levels drop dramatically in altitude from day to night. Scientifically rich, Venus is also an ideal location for implementing aerobraking techniques. Its thick lower atmosphere and slow planet rotation result in relatively more predictable atmospheric densities than Mars. The upper atmosphere (aerobraking altitudes) of Venus has a density variation of 8% compared to Mars 30% variability. In general, most aerobraking missions try to minimize the duration of the aerobraking phase to keep costs down. These short phases have limited margin to account for contingencies. It is the stable and predictive nature of Venus atmosphere that provides safer aerobraking opportunities. The nature of aerobraking at Venus provides ideal opportunities to demonstrate aerobraking enhancements and techniques yet to be used at Mars, such as flying a temperature corridor (versus a heat-rate corridor) and using a thermal-response surface algorithm and autonomous aerobraking, shifting many daily ground activities to onboard the spacecraft. A defined aerobraking temperature corridor, based on spacecraft component maximum temperatures, can be employed on a spacecraft specifically designed for aerobraking, and will predict subsequent aerobraking orbits and prescribe apoapsis propulsive maneuvers to maintain the spacecraft within its specified temperature limits. A spacecraft specifically designed for aerobraking in the Venus environment can provide a cost-effective platform for achieving these expanded science and technology goals. This paper discusses the scientific merits of a low-altitude, near-circular orbit at Venus, highlights the differences in aerobraking at Venus versus Mars, and presents design data using a flight system specifically designed for an aerobraking mission at Venus. Using aerobraking to achieve a low altitude orbit at Venus may pave the way for various technology demonstrations, such as autonomous aerobraking techniques and/or new science measurements like a multi-mode, synthetic aperture radar capable of altimetry and radiometry with performance that is significantly more capable than Magellan. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved."""

Among these parameters, special attention has been put on the evaluation of the available solar resource, the analysis of the IEA predicted values for the cumulative installed capacity, the initial (2010) cost of the system, the discount and learning rates, etc. One significant contribution of our work is that the predicted evolution of the LCOEs strongly depend, not only on the particular values of the cumulative installed capacity function in the targeted years, but mainly on the specific curved time-paths which are followed by this function. The results obtained in this work are shown both graphically and numerically. Finally, the implications that the results could have in energy planning policies and grid parity calculations are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."""

A treated sewage source heat pump system was designed and used at Beijing Olympic Village in 2008 to provide heating and cooling, which is a green approach to recovering urban heat. However, treated sewage contains components that can cause fouling, such as heterotrophic bacteria, microbial nutrients and suspended substances. These could not be completely removed during treatments conducted by the wastewater treatment plants, and biofouling inevitably occurs in the plate heat exchangers of the treated sewage used in the heat pump systems. In order to understand the characteristics of the biofouling, an experimental system, which mimicked the treated sewage water and simulated the relevant fouling formation process, was developed in our laboratory. The flow cell in the system, which was used to imitate plate heat exchangers, allowed sample surfaces properly retrieved and analyzed. Extensive experimentations including process monitoring and microstructure development in biofilm were conducted and the results presented in this paper showed the possibility of reducing the biofouling in the future. Under typical heating and cooling conditions of heat pump, the growth curves of biofouling were generated from different weight values, the micromorphic evolution of biofouling was characterized by using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy. A series of quantitative information was obtained and discussed. In particular, the effects of flow velocity and bacterial concentration were investigated, which clearly influenced the biofilm development, thus impacting the thermal resistance created. It was found that the biofouling growth rate changed synchronously with the micromorphic evolution, and the effect of flow velocity on biofouling formation was non-monotonic. Biofouling would be neglected when the bacterial concentration decreased to 10 3 CFU·ml -1(CFU, colony formine unit).

The method is explained and validated by showing that it finds the optimum solution that is the upper boundary for time-shifting revenue. In other words, a storage operator could never derive more revenue than this value from time-shifting alone and calculating this upper-boundary gives a reference value to compare the efficacy of other methods of estimation.

This paper presents results of the long term (3,800 hours) operation of a micro CHP (mCHP) system that was retrofitted to a manufacturing plant located in Regina, Saskatchewan, in order to provide the building with base load space heating and on-site electrical energy production. The prototype mCHP system was developed to SRC's specifications for this project, by a third party, using commercially available component technologies, and it is the first mCHP system to offer a 5.6 kW electric + 13 kW thermal output rating with on-grid/off-grid functionality. It was commissioned in March 2010. The mCHP system was integrated into the existing heating system through the addition of hydronic heating coils installed in the forced air heating ductwork served by the existing natural gas furnaces and a heat recovery ventilator. The heat recovered from the mCHP unit was buffered by a hot water storage tank. Results and key findings up to March 2011 showed that the system achieved a long term average combined electrical and thermal efficiency of 69.6 % (higher heating value basis). Parasitic loads equated to 15% of total generation of electrical energy over the year, most of which were attributable to pumps required to move heat from the unit to the hydronic coils.

Further this process is not carbon-neutral, since it uses coke and woodchips as reducing agents, causing considerable deforestation. Scientists and technologists across the world realize that spending so much money and energy to produce silicon can be avoided and have thereby begun to research on alternative technologies to produce silicon for the solar industry. As a result several new and disruptive technologies have emerged such as solar grade silicon (SoG) also known as UMG (Upgraded Metallurgical Grade) silicon, which involve substantially lesser resources in terms of capital &amp	" energy and are therefore carbon-neutral at the end of the day.

For many years to come Silicon (Si) solar cells will contribute significantly towards production of mono and multi crystalline PV modules. If India has to achieve the target, over and above set by the NSM then it must begin to focus on producing Si by adopting new processes that have been aforementioned.

A green roof based on three kinds of vegetation, namely Plectranthus neochilus, Kalanchoe longiflora and Sedum reflexum species was compared to a reference bituminous roof during the summer season. The green roof performance was explored by evaluating its effect on temperature fluctuations and heat fluxes. The results showed that the presence of plants led to a decrease in temperature reaching 6.7±0.1°C under the green roof. Each plant also contributed to a low heat flux exchange through the green roof. Indeed, Sedum presented an average heat flux exchange of 1.4±0.3% as compared to Plectranthus (2.3±0.2%) and Kalanchoe (2.2±0.4%). Moreover, Sedum also led to a higher restitution of heat gain (63%) than Plectranthus (54%) and Kalanchoe (51%). Finally, the determination of major parameters including U-value, R-value and k-value, demonstrated the thermal and energetic behavior of the green roof and helped to show Sedum properties for a green roof based in the tropical environment of La Reunion Island.

In this paper, we discuss the aspect of the risk minimization of an LSE by purchasing electricity at a volatile and risky spot market price, while meeting the end-users' energy needs represented by a state space model and constraints of an optimization problem. We propose a new concept that looks not only into the risk at the independent time steps in a single spot market but also into the correlated risks between different time steps and different spot markets, using Markowitz optimization. The proposed concept is also novel in the sense that it deploys loads with different physical characteristics (or storage with different time constants) for the spot markets with different time scales and intervals. We show through a simulation a possible benefit and drawback of this LSE's risk minimization framework compared to cost minimization without risk management. We conclude that there is a clear tradeoff between minimizing the risk of uncertainty and maximizing the profit of an LSE.

IRISS has investigated whether space assets can add value where conventional technologies face limitations. For example the existing 'balise' train location system provides low accuracy, while backcountry routes may still have poor communications coverage by terrestrial networks.

In a non-homogeneous design paradigm that contains high power-density superthreshold blocks abutting sub-threshold blocks, it becomes imperative to examine the effects of a variable ambient temperature on sub-threshold circuit operation. Unlike super-threshold, the sub-threshold I ON increases exponentially with temperature but the ION-to-I OFF ratio degrades by 0.52%/°C in 45 nm technology due to an increase in inverse sub-threshold slope (S) values with temperature. Temperature as an environmental variable presents 2 design-corners in sub-threshold: (1) very low temperatures of operation (??25 °C) could affect the timing-yield since the circuits become slower and the delay-sensitivity to process-variations also increases manifold and (2) very high temperatures of operation (?125 °C) could potentially affect the functional yield since the Static Noise Margin (SNM) values degrade significantly. The total energy consumed also increases significantly due to a tremendous increase in the relative contribution of E leak at higher temperatures. Although performance is a secondary design objective in sub-threshold, it is extremely necessary that the circuits satisfy timing constraints imposed by the worst-case process and operating corners. To incorporate the effect of temperature on timing-yield of sub-threshold circuits, we propose 2 metrics to describe the practical-energy consumption: T-Induced-E maxTcycle and PT -Induced-E worst-caseTcycle which are the energy consumed per cycle for temperature induced maximum cycle-time and process and temperature induced worst-case cycle-time respectively. The practical energy values are &gt"	10× greater than E nom/cycle and exhibit significant temperature dependence causing the V DDmin (supply yielding minimum energy) to be pushed to a much higher value for a higher temperature of operation. Using these metrics, we study the temperature effects on the design-space in terms of the different circuit-design choices: gate-sizing, fan-out per gate and logicdepth. From the timing-variability perspective, long-paths constructed using low fan-out, upsized gates represent the best-case. For a circuit of the same topology (gate-arrangement, logic-depth and fan-out), the practical energy values increase as gates in the circuit are uniformly upsized. To evaluate the relative trade-off between energy-consumption and process-robustness under the combined effects of process-variations and thermal stress, we use a metric called Practical-Energy- Variability-Product (PEVP) which is the product of PT -Induced-E worst-caseTcycle and the coefficient of variability of T cycle under current operating conditions. Paths which simultaneously minimize timingvariability, satisfy worst-case cycle-times and optimize the total energy consumed are those constructed using minimum sized gates in spite of their much higher vulnerability to process-variations. The results obtained are for circuits with &gt	99.9% timing yield and having a relatively high and pessimistic supply-voltage of 350 mV. Allowing scope for supply-tuning while ensuring &gt	"99.9% functional yield we found that the PEVP values can be reduced by ?75% across the design-space for different circuit topologies. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved."""

This study is based on previous modification to an existing flow, sediment dynamics, and water-quality code (SNL-EFDC) where a simulation of an experimental flume is used to qualify, quantify, and visualize the influence of MHK energy generation. Turbulence and device parameters are calibrated against wake data from a flume experiment out of the University of Southampton (L. Myers and A. S.

To achieve a realistic velocity deficit within the wake of the device, parametric studies using the nonlinear, model-independent, parameter estimators PEST and DAKOTA were compared to determine parameter sensitivities and optimal values for various constants in the flow and turbulence closure equations. The sensitivity analyses revealed that the Smagorinski subgrid-scale horizontal momentum diffusion constant and the k-? kinetic energy dissipation rate constant (C ?4) were the two most important parameters influencing wake profile and dissipation at 10 or more device diameters downstream as they strongly influence how the wake mixes with the bulk flow.

Use of NEA in stationary natural gas engines has shown up to 70% NOx reduction with a modest 2% nitrogen enrichment. However, nitrogen enrichment beyond a point leads to degradation in engine performance in terms of power density, brake thermal efficiency and unburned hydrocarbons. Optimizing the nitrogen enrichment levels to reduce NOx without performance degradation of the engine would greatly benefit the advancement of the air separation membrane technology. Development of fast and robust modeling tools to compute the temporal variation of the in-cylinder engine pressure, temperature and NO x formation can aid experimental efforts in determining the optimum enrichment levels for a given engine operating condition. This work presents a methodology to compute engine-out NOx for engines with and without nitrogen enrichment. Temporal variation of in-cylinder engine pressure and temperature can be obtained by a solution of the energy equation. Using these temperature and pressure values, along with the instantaneous composition of the working fluid, one can evaluate the equilibrium concentration of the combustion products. Since the NOxformation freezes a few crank angle degrees after the completion of combustion, it is instructive to examine whether the equilibrium computation can provide a reasonable estimate of engine-out NO x. To this end, engine-out NOx computed by using the above-mentioned procedure was obtained as a function of equivalence ratio for cases with nitrogen enrichment of 2% and no nitrogen enrichment.

The EU Waste Incineration Directive defines a maximum emission limit value for NOx of 200 mg/Nm 3 as a daily average value referred to 11% O 2. Based on National Emission Ceilings (NEC) defined by the Gothenburg Protocol, it can be expected that the limit values for NO x in the EU will become even more stringent. In some European countries (e.g. The Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland) a lower emission limit has already been introduced. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technologies are used in many cases to achieve the above-mentioned NO x limits. However, there are drawbacks to SCR systems such as high investment cost. Operation cost is also quite high due to the energy consumption necessary for the reheating of the flue gas as well as the increased pressure loss. Innovative technologies are therefore required to make it possible to reconcile both requirements: reduced emissions and increased energy efficiency. Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems are based on the selective reaction of ammonia or urea injected into the upper furnace. In many cases SNCR technologies are limited by the ammonia slip which increases in case of more stringent NO x requirements. According to the relevant BREF document, an ammonia slip limit of 10 mg/Nm 3 is generally required at the stack. In order to achieve reduced NO x values, it is necessary to implement measures to reduce ammonia slip, by means of either a wet scrubber or a High-dust catalytic converter. EfW plants in Mainz (Germany) and Brescia (Italy) are examples of operational plants combining SNCR with such a catalytic converter type. In addition R&amp"	"D activities are carried out on the development of simplified reaction mechanisms to be implemented in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. With these tools it will be possible to describe the interaction between turbulent mixing, radiation and chemical reaction rates. Another option to achieve low NO x values (below 100 mg/Nm 3) is the reduction of NO x by so-called primary measures, e.g. the Very Low NO x process (VLN), which has been developed by MARTIN jointly with its cooperation partners. The VLN process is based on a grate-based combustion system. The """"VLN gas"""" is drawn off at the rear end of the grate and is reintroduced into the upper furnace in the vicinity of the SNCR injection positions. NO x will be reduced significantly, ensuring low NO x emission values at the stack as required, at low values for ammonia slip. The new EfW plant in Honolulu (USA) will be equipped with the VLN process. In Coburg (Germany), the VLN process will be retrofitted in an existing installation.

The results from these experiments were further modeled using the Voigt based model, in which the thickness, shear modulus, and shear viscosity values of the adsorbed EPS layers on the PVDF crystal were calculated. The observations in the QCM-D suggested that the elevated fouling of the UF membrane is due to higher adherence of the EPS as well as reduction in viscosity and elasticity of the EPS adsorbed layer and elevation of the EPS fluidity.

But while energy security and efficiency are valued in the general sense, for FOBs, energy and water are strategically vital and sources of vulnerability. There are incredibly high human and capital costs associated with transporting fuel and water within hostile war zones, where convoys are routinely subjected to mortal danger.

The metrics associated with this framework focus on the volume of field equipment itself, as well as the volumes of fuel and water that are either consumed or saved by the equipment over time. For example, solar panels require additional up-front volume to be brought to the FOB, but then spare future volumes of fuel that need not be shipped. Using a volumetric framework described herein, the tradeoffs between up-front and marginal volumetric requirements can be rigorously assessed. Existing metrics, such as those that focus only on equipment lifecycle cost, are unsuitable for evaluating field equipment for FOBs primarily because they are extremely difficult to accurately quantify. By instead focusing on fuel and water volumes that are more easily quantified, decision-makers might gain important insights about the relevant trade-offs and strategic implications of fielding equipment on FOBs. The proposed metrics are compared to existing metrics with respect to their effectiveness for quantifying the true values of energy- and water-saving devices on FOBs in a strategically relevant way.

The paradigm shift is so paramount that one speaks of the """"Hydrogen Economy"""", as the energy in this new and ecological type of economy is to be distributed by hydrogen. However, H 2 is not a primary energy source but rather an energy carrier, a means of storing, transporting and distributing energy, which has to be generated by other means. Various H 2 storage methods are possible"	" however industries' favourite is the storage of gaseous hydrogen in high pressure tanks. The biggest promoter of this storage methodology is the automotive industry, which is currently preparing for the generation change from the fossil fuel internal combustion engines to hydrogen based fuel cells. The current roadmaps foresee a market roll-out by 2015, when the hydrogen supply infrastructure is expected to have reached a critical mass. The hydrogen economy is about to take off as being demonstrated by various national mobility strategies, which foresee several millions of electric cars driving on the road in 2020. Fuel cell cars are only one type of """"electric car"""", battery electric as well as hybrid cars - all featuring electric drive trains - are the others. Which type of technology is chosen for a specific application depends primarily on the involved energy storage and power requirements. These considerations are very similar to the ones in the aerospace sector, which had introduced the fuel cell already in the 1960s. The automotive sector followed only recently, but has succeeded in moving forward the technology to a level, where the aerospace sector is starting considering to spin-in terrestrial hydrogen technologies into its technology portfolio. Target areas are again high power/high energy applications like aviation, manned spaceflight and exploration missions, as well as future generation high power telecommunication satellites. Similar trends can be expected in the future for RADAR Earth Observation satellites and space infrastructure concepts of great scale. This paper examines current activities along the hydrogen value chain, both in the terrestrial and the aerospace sector. A general assessment of the synergy potential is complemented by a thorough analysis of specific applications serving as role models like a lunar manned base or pressurised rover, an aircraft APU or a high power telecommunications satellite.

Within this study, the costs of GHG mitigation and fossil fuel replacement (abatement costs) of established and upcoming bioenergy technologies for heat, electricity and transport fuel production are assessed. Sensitivity analyses and projections up to 2030 illustrate the effect of dynamic parameters on specific abatement costs.The results show that the abatement costs of wood-based heat generation technologies substituting oil-fired boilers and gas-fired heating plants, respectively, are in the range of -45 € per ton CO2-equivalent (€/t CO2-eq.) and -11 € per MWh higher heating value (€/MWhHHV) to 93€/t CO2-eq. and 24 €/MWhHHV. Heating systems around 50kW show the lowest abatement costs. For combined heat and power (CHP) plants, two different cases with regard to heat utilization are assumed. In an optimal mode (100% of generated heat displaces fossil fuel-based heat production), abatement costs of wood-based technologies, substituting electricity from modern combined cycle gas turbines, range from 5€/t CO2-eq. and 1€/MWhHHV to 201€/t CO2-eq. and 38 €/MWhHHV. Representative values of typical CHP plants with a capacity of 1MWel and more are in the magnitude of 50€/t CO2-eq. and 10 €/MWhHHV. Under less favorable conditions (3000 heat full load hours per year), abatement costs of typical plants are around 100€/t CO2-eq. and 17 €/MWhHHV higher. The costs of GHG mitigation and fossil fuel saving with established transport fuels (biodiesel and ethanol) range from 71€/t CO2-eq. and 8 €/MWhHHV to 200€/t CO2-eq. and 82 €/MWhHHV.

Two kinds of feedstock are considered: oil-producing feedstock (i.e., camelina and algae) and lignocellulosic biomass (i.e., corn stover, switchgrass, and short rotation woody crops). By factoring in farmer/feedstock producer and biorefinery profitability requirements and risk attitudes, land availability and suitability, as well as a time delay and technological learning factor, a more realistic estimate of the level of biojet supply and emissions reduction can be developed under different oil price assumptions.

Since data centers spend up to half their energy on cooling, cooling systems becomes a key factor for energy consumption reduction strategies and alternatives in the data centers. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of an absorption chiller driven by solar thermal energy as cooling plant alternative for data centers. Source primary energy consumption is used to compare the performance of different solar cooling plants with a standard cooling plant. The solar cooling plants correspond to different combinations of solar collector arrays and thermal storage tank, with a boiler as source of energy to ensure continuous operation of the absorption chiller. The standard cooling plant uses an electric chiller. Results suggest that the solar cooling plant with flat-plate solar collectors is a better option over the solar cooling plant with evacuated-tube solar collectors. However, although solar cooling plants can decrease the primary energy consumption when compared with the standard cooling plant, the net present value of the cost to install and operate the solar cooling plants are higher than the one for the standard cooling plant. © 2011 by ASME."""

Buildings will contain a variety of systems devised by many people, and yet the relationship between buildings and people can only work satisfactorily if there is integration between the supply- and demand-side stakeholders as well as between the occupants, the systems and the building. To achieve this, systems thinking is essential in planning, design and management, together with the ability to create and innovate while remaining practical (see Glossary). The ultimate objective should be simplicity rather than complexity. This requires not only technical ability but also the powers of interpretation, imagination and even intuition. Building Regulations can stifle creativity but are necessary to set a minimum level of expectation and obey health and safety requirements. However, we should aim at designing well above these conditions. After all, buildings form our architectural landscape and they, and the environment they generate, should uplift the soul and the spirit of those people within them as well as those who pass by them. The creation of shared visions, effective teams, clear structures and robust processes ensures that the intelligent building being constructed will demonstrate the purpose for which it was conceived. Times are changing as technology and society evolve, so there needs to be a long-term outlook by the team. Key innovation issues for intelligent buildings include sustainability (energy, water, waste and pollution), the use of information and communication technology, robotics, embedded sensor technology, smart-materials technology including nanotechnology, health in the workplace and social change. Smart materials in facades, for example, will provide sophisticated forms of feedback and high levels of control besides regulating thermal transmission. Eventually by coating and embedding materials with nanoparticles we will be able to specify material properties much more easily. Self-healing materials will revolutionize facades in the future. Pelletier and Bose (2010) describe how a concrete matrix embedded with capsules of sodium silicate healing agent can repair cracks by the sodium silicate from the ruptured capsules interacting with the calcium hydroxide in the concrete to form a gel that seals the cracks. However, innovation must be an enabler rather than an end in itself. Passive environmental design is equally important so that the energy demands are minimized by using natural means such as mass, orientation and building form to capture sunlight, fresh air and rain water. The intelligent buildings control markets are strong worldwide even after the gloomy economic period of 2009. The largest markets are in the USA, Asia, Middle East and Europe but some smaller countries are showing rapid growth. BSRIA Member e-News August 2009 shows that Scandinavia, Germany and Qatar spend most per capita on sophisticated intelligent controls. The increasing demand for sustainable, healthy and low-carbon intelligent buildings seems likely to sustain this dynamic market. Building management systems (BMSs) provide control and interoperability between the various systems servicing the building. Innovations such as internet-based, common, open communication standards and protocols increasingly make it more important to integrate the systems within intelligent buildings. This in turn will require an extended range of professional expertise that could force a cultural change. A key driver is the sustainability agenda. This article is about the actions and trends that are necessary to achieve a sustainable intelligent building. Such buildings need intelligent infrastructures and serve communities that demand new master planning approaches, and these will feature in a later special issue. © 2011 Derek Clements-Croome."""

A special syngas-water heat exchanger is designed to recover energy of the hot syngas and to avoid corrosion of HCl gas under high temperature and of hydrochloric acid below the dew point. Meanwhile, dioxins formation is prevented, since the cooling process duration of syngas is shorter than 0.5 second under 200°C to 500°C."""

If radiation hits memory elements, this is usually called an """"single-event upset or """"soft error as it can further propagate as a full cycle error. The problem of soft errors is further exacerbated in large multiprocessors employed in servers in which reliability is a key concern. In the past, the technique of lockstep execution of the original and the duplicate instructions has been used for error detection in multiprocessors. However, the execution of redundant threads in the on-chip multiprocessor (CMP) provides error detection at lower overheads, since the branch outcomes of the leading thread can be exploited during the execution of the trailing thread, and also because the interprocessor communication latency is a key concern for lockstepping. In this paper, we show that by mining various redundancies inherent within a single core, the interprocessor communication can be brought down to a minimum. Toward this, we propose techniques based on 1) temporal redundancy, 2) data value redundancy, and 3) information redundancy for error detection in multicore designs. We exploit temporal redundancy by using the """"latency slack cycles (LSC) of an instruction, which we define as the number of cycles before the computed result from the instruction becomes the source operand of a subsequent instruction. The value-based detection technique is explored by exploiting the width of the operands with small data values and information redundancy is exploited by the generation of residue code check bits for the source operands. We show that with a clustered core multiprocessor, the interprocessor communication overhead can be significantly reduced. In our proposed multicore design, when a soft error is detected, error correction is achieved by rolling back the execution to a previous checkpoint state and re-executing the instructions. The proposed techniques have been implemented on the RSIM simulation framework and validated using the SPLASH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the soft error detection schemes proposed in this work, can be implemented, on the average, with less than 10 percent increase in CPI on modern multicore designs. © 2011 IEEE."""

They are examined with regard to their effectiveness and efficiency in the fields of generation, transmission, distribution and supply. Finally, potential obstacles that may defer the introduction of ICT into the power system are shown. The analysis suggests that if certain hurdles are taken, the huge potential of ICT can create additional value in various fields of the whole power value chain. This ranges from increased energy efficiency and the more sophisticated integration of decentralised (renewable) energy plants to a higher security of supply and more efficient organisation of market processes.

Several capital budgeting decision criteria have been used (the payback period, the net present value and the internal rate of return) to study whether or not an investment should be considered worthwhile. The results show that, independent of the capital budgeting decision criteria used, the number of cost-effective retrofitting possibilities available is large compared to the rate of improvements that the industry undertakes annually. This shows the insensitivity of the industry to financial criteria when it comes to making their investment decisions. The possible thermal energy improvement in the clinker production, if all these BATs were implemented, has been quantified to be around 10%. This achievement would place the cement industry in the upper bound of the benchmark range for clinker manufacture. However considering the delays observed nowadays in terms of diffusion of BATs in the cement industry, it requires a conducive policy environment that combines support for both technology development and to their deployment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Ownership and usage of energy-saving technologies for in-home appliances (or vehicles) might lead to the increase in out-of-home (or in-home) energy consumption. It is therefore necessary to jointly represent in-home and out-of-home energy consumption in the same modeling framework. With this consideration, we first build a new type of energy consumption model based on the Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) modeling framework. Next, we conducted a questionnaire survey in Beijing in 2009 and successfully collected the information about households' energy consumption, ownership/usage of in-home appliances and vehicles, and households' and their members' attributes from 1014 households. Throughout an empirical analysis, it is confirmed that the MDCEV model is effective to simultaneously describe the in-home and out-of-home energy consumption behavior.

The seed mixed microflora was obtained from a lab-scale agitated granular sludge bed bioreactor. This pilot-scale fermentor was operated for 67 days at 35 °C, an organic loading rate (OLR) of 40-240 kg COD/m3/d, and the influent sucrose concentration of 20 and 40 kg COD/m3.

The biogas consisted mainly of H2 and CO 2 with a H2 content range of 23.2-37.8%. At an OLR of 240 kg COD/m3/d, the hydrogen content in biogas reached its maximum value of 37% with a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 15.59 m3/m 3/d and a hydrogen yield of 1.04 mol H2/mol sucrose.

This paper describes seven methods of determining the bandgap of HfO2 using SE. Five of these methods are based on direct data inversion (point-by-point fitting) combined with a linear extrapolation, while two of the methods involve a dispersion model-based bandgap extraction.

The authors also observed that, for each of these methods, there was a trend of increasing bandgap with decreasing film thickness, which is attributed to quantum confinement.

They can exist in two competing morphologies, a cylindrically symmetric barrel state completely engulfing the fiber and an asymmetric clamshell state, in which the drop touches the fiber only sideways. Despite their omnipresence and their practical relevance, e.g. for the adherence of drops to fibers in separation technology and filter materials, the physical mechanisms governing the stability of the two morphologies remained elusive. Using electrowetting-functionalized fibers we can tune the wettability of the fibers and thereby reversibly switch between the two states. This allows determination of the stability limits of both morphologies as a function of the two relevant control parameters, namely the contact angle and the liquid volume. While clamshells are found to prevail for large contact angles and small volumes, and barrels prevail for small angles and large volumes, there is also a wide range of intermediate parameter values, for which both morphologies are mechanically stable. Mapping out the energy landscape of the system by numerical minimization of the free energy we find that the barrel state is easily deformed by non-axisymmetric perturbations. Such perturbations facilitate the transition to the clamshell state and thereby the removal of drops from the fibers.

Fish's swimming motion is more effective and efficient than propeller screw propulsion which is more popular for underwater vehicles. So far, a lot of fish-like robots that have several actuated joints have been developed. They realize arbitrary motion by controlling the joint angles simultaneously. On the other hand, using an elastic fin may reduce the number of actuated joints and the total energy consumption. The purpose of this paper is to develop a fish-like robot driven by a single actuator with an elastic tail fin. Design/methodology/approach - Since an elastic plate appropriately bends due to the interaction to the surrounding fluid, a robot with the elastic fin can swim smoothly even though it has only a single actuated joint. However, in order to improve the swimming performances, it is required to optimize the shape of fin (width, thickness, distribution, etc.). Although computational fluid dynamics technique is one of the methods to assess the effectiveness of a certain shape of fin, it may take longer to obtain the results. Therefore, in this study, a simplified simulator is constructed and a better shape of fin is explored. Findings - Four types of fin shape were prepared and the swimming experiments were conducted. The swimming velocity changed according to the frequency and the shape of fin. In order to find the optimal shape of fin, the simulator of five-link model surrounded by fluid is constructed. The differences of velocity can be found according to the parameters of fin shape. The simulation showed the similar trend as the experiments although the absolute values of velocity did not correspond. It is thought that the developed simulator can estimate the relative performance of fins. Originality/value - Most fish robots that have been developed so far consist of rigid links and multi-actuated joints, which can realize arbitrary motion by controlling the joint angles simultaneously. On the other hand, using an elastic plate as a tail fin may reduce the number of actuated joints and the total energy consumption although it is not easy to realize arbitrary attitude. In this paper, a fish-like robot driven by a single actuator with an elastic tail fin was developed. This technique makes the mechanism of a fish-like robot simple. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."""

In preparation for implementation of a cap and trade program under this Act, Chevron has undertaken a detailed assessment of greenhouse gas mitigation options and costs. Such an assessment is key to making compliance decisions within the constraints of a given cap and trade regime. If the cap and trade market is minimally restricted (i.e., recognizes that climate change is a global issue and thus has no geographic restrictions and no set requirement for onsite emission reductions), facilities can make the best economic (and environmental) choices of where to 'make' emission reductions inside the facility fenceline and when to 'buy' the emission reduction allowances or credits on the market. The scope of the study included Chevron's two refineries and a large heavy oil steamflood production operation in California. This paper will discuss how mitigation technologies are identified and assessed, describe some of the key greenhouse gas mitigation alternatives of interest to the Chevron California facilities and present a business-based approach to analyzing mitigation costs. Technologies studied included energy efficiency, advanced energy (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, nuclear, low temperature heat recovery) and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). For each mitigation option, a consistent methodology, based on the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association/American Petroleum Institute (IPIECA/API) Guidelines for Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Projects was used to assess baseline or 'business as usual' emissions, net emission reductions due to the project, capital cost, operating cost and any project benefits (e.g., reduced fuel use for energy efficiency projects). These values were then entered into a business evaluation tool to calculate a Net Present Value for each option. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd."""

In this context """"risk evaluation"""" encompasses multiple scales. Yet a risk management program aims to maximize the chance of project success by assessing, monitoring, minimizing all risks in a consistent framework. The 150,000-km2 Illinois Basin underlies much of the state of Illinois, USA, and parts of adjacent Kentucky and Indiana. Its potential for CO2 storage is first-rate among basins in North America, an impression that has been strengthened by early testing of the injection well of the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium's (MGSC's) Phase III large scale demonstration project, the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project (IBDP). The IBDP, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), represents a key trial of GS technologies and project-management techniques. Though risks are specific to each site and project, IBDP risk management methodologies provide valuable experience for future GS projects. IBDP views risk as the potential for negative impact to any of these five values: health and safety, environment, financial, advancing the viability and public acceptability of a GS industry, and research. Research goals include monitoring one million metric tonnes of injected CO2 in the subsurface. Risk management responds to the ways in which any values are at risk: for example, monitoring is designed to reduce uncertainties in parameter values that are important for research and system control, and is also designed to provide public assurance. Identified risks are the primary basis for risk-reduction measures: risks linked to uncertainty in geologic parameters guide further characterization work and guide simulations applied to performance evaluation. Formally, industry defines risk (more precisely risk criticality) as the product L*S, the Likelihood multiplied by the Severity of negative impact. L and S are each evaluated on five-point scales, yielding a theoretical spread in risk values of 1 through 25. So defined, these judgment-based values are categorical and ordinal - they do not represent physically measurable quantities, but are nonetheless useful for comparison and therefore decision support. The """"risk entities"""" first evaluated are FEPs - conceptual Features, Events, and Processes based on the list published by Quintessa Ltd. After concrete scenarios are generated based on selected FEPs, scenarios become the critical entities whose associated risks are evaluated and tracked. In IBDP workshops, L and S values for 123 FEPs were generated through expert elicitation. About 30 experts in the project or in GS in general were assigned among six facilitated working groups, and each group was charged to envision risks within a sphere of project operations. Working groups covered FEPs with strong spatial characteristics - such as those related to the injection wellbore and simulated plume footprint - and """"nonspatial"""" FEPs related to finance, regulations, legal, and stakeholder issues. Within these working groups, experts shared information, examined assumptions, refined and extended the FEP list, calibrated responses, and provided initial L and S values by consensus. Individual rankings were collected in a follow-up process via emailed spreadsheets. For each of L and S, three values were collected: Lower Bound, Best Guess, and Upper Bound. The Lower-Upper Bound ranges and the spreads among experts can be interpreted to yield rough confidence measures. Based on experts' responses, FEPs were ranked in terms of their L*S risk levels. FEP rankings were determined from individual (not consensus or averaged) results, thus no high-risk responses were damped out. The higher-risk FEPs were used to generate one or more concrete, well defined risk-bearing scenarios for each FEP. Any FEP scored by any expert as having associated risk of at least moderate level - roughly the top half of the evaluated list - was used to generate risk scenarios. Textual risk-response information collected during the FEP evaluation process was augmented after scenarios were defined. Risk responses were then disaggregated into approximately 200 risk-response actions, which were regrouped into 30 areas of function or expertise. Each """"risk response action group"""" has been assigned to a specific individual to organize and confirm its execution. Responses to the higher identified risks have influenced plans for reservoir characterization, monitoring, communications, and coordination among project member organizations. Uncertainties in geologic parameters are being addressed through sensitivity analysis in reservoir simulations and through further data acquisition. Because the risk-bearing scenarios are linked to formal, assigned risk-response actions, they provide a basis for tracking and managing risk throughout the project. Important benefits of face-to-face, """"live"""" expert elicitation include team formation and the subsequent establishment of project understandings, roles, and working relationships. Interchanges that occur during a FEPs-based elicitation process can stimulate conceiving and considering risk-bearing chains of events, and can help avoid blind spots that could occur if all scenarios were pre-defined. Through using both group-consensus and individual values, the IBDP risk management process benefited from group discussion and calibration, while avoiding the impairment of independent judgment that can arise through group dynamics. Further developments in collecting, analyzing, and managing the risk-evaluation data are expected to streamline risk management tasks, and to provide suitable risk management frameworks that are more broadly applicable to geological sequestration. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd."""

The approach adopted is to consider the technology, its expected costs and revenues, and related risks from an investor perspective. To this end we develop an investment model that is used to calculate the economic feasibility of PBRs for different scenarios, including a best-case scenario, with plenty of sunlight and water, inexpensive nutrients, high prices for hydrogen and biomass, and low other costs. The best-case scenario is compared to a scenario with less favorable boundary conditions. We find that PBR efficiencies will likely be less than 10%, with typical values between 1.8% and 5.6%. We also find that hydrogen production costs would be lower than those for biodiesel or biogas from solid biomass produced in PBRs. Compared to biofuels from traditional agriculture there is a great advantage for the PBR technology if land is scarce, because land is used more efficiently. Since PBRs can be designed as a closed system they can be applied in very dry regions.

Gasification and flash pyrolysis are promising technologies for the conversion of SRC into energy or chemicals. A model has been developed to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the cash flows generated by an investment in gasification or flash pyrolysis of SRC for the production of electricity or for combined heat and power production. The NPV has been calculated and compared for (combined heat and) power stations with an electrical capacity (Pe) between 5 MW and 20 MW. Furthermore the minimal amount of heat that has to be sold to make combined heat and power production more profitable than pure electricity production has been determined. By performing Monte Carlo simulations, key variables that influence the NPV have been identified. In the case of small scale SRC conversion, i.e. at an electrical capacity of 5 MW-10 MW, flash pyrolysis is more profitable than gasification. At the smallest scale of 5 MW it is necessary to invest in combined heat and power production, as the sole production of electricity is not profitable at this low scale. At an electrical capacity of 10 MW flash pyrolysis for the sole production of electricity becomes profitable, but gasification for electricity production is still not viable.

Hence, a system was developed at HJS Emission Technology GmbH to inject catalyst-precursor into the exhaust gas pipe, whereby the catalysts are generated due to decomposition of the precursor in the hot exhaust gas. A technique based on the calculation of apparent activation energies was developed to characterize the soot combustion on the filter. In the first step metal oxide catalysts, like cerium(IV)oxide, manganese-oxide and iron(III)oxide were investigated after injection of their nitrate precursors dissolved in water.

Grid-connected PV is usually perceived as an energy technology for developed countries, whereas isolated, stand-alone PV is considered as more suited for applications in developing nations, where so many individuals still lack access to electricity. This rationale is based on the still high costs of PV when compared with conventional electricity. We make the case for grid-connected PV generation in Brazil, showing that with the declining costs of PV and the rising prices of conventional electricity, urban populations in Brazil will also enjoy grid parity in the present decade.

In the first design phase, important global design decisions are made on the basis of plant-wide optimization studies with the aim of increasing IGCC thermal efficiency and thereby making better use of coal resources and reducing CO 2 emissions. For the design of an IGCC plant with 90% CO2 capture, the optimal combination of the extent of carbon monoxide (CO) conversion in the water-gas shift (WGS) reactors and the extent of CO 2 capture in the SELEXOL process, using dimethylether of polyethylene glycol as the solvent, is determined in the first phase. In the second design phase, the impact of local design decisions is explored considering the optimum values of the decision variables from the first phase as additional constraints. Two decisions are made focusing on the SELEXOL and Claus unit. In the third design phase, the operating conditions are optimized considering the optimum values of the decision variables from the first and second phases as additional constraints.

While fossil-derived synthetic fuels (e.g. coal derived liquid fuels) and biofuels have received the most attention, similar hydrocarbons can be produced without using fossil fuels or biomass. Using renewable and/or nuclear energy, carbon dioxide and water can be recycled into liquid hydrocarbon fuels in non-biological processes which remove oxygen from CO2 and H 2O (the reverse of fuel combustion). Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere would enable a closed-loop carbon-neutral fuel cycle. This article critically reviews the many possible technological pathways for recycling CO2 into fuels using renewable or nuclear energy, considering three stages-CO2 capture, H2O and CO 2 dissociation, and fuel synthesis. Dissociation methods include thermolysis, thermochemical cycles, electrolysis, and photoelectrolysis of CO2 and/or H2O. High temperature co-electrolysis of H 2O and CO2 makes very efficient use of electricity and heat (near-100% electricity-to-syngas efficiency), provides high reaction rates, and directly produces syngas (CO/H2 mixture) for use in conventional catalytic fuel synthesis reactors. Capturing CO2 from the atmosphere using a solid sorbent, electrolyzing H2O and CO2 in solid oxide electrolysis cells to yield syngas, and converting the syngas to gasoline or diesel by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is identified as one of the most promising, feasible routes. An analysis of the energy balance and economics of this CO2 recycling process is presented. We estimate that the full system can feasibly operate at 70% electricity-to-liquid fuel efficiency (higher heating value basis) and the price of electricity needed to produce synthetic gasoline at U.S.D$ 2/gal ($ 0.53/L) is 2-3 U.S. cents/kWh.

The GHG balances show that the Reno-Nord incineration plant has changed from a net annual GHG emission of 30kgCO 2-eq person-1 year-1 to a net annual GHG saving of 770kgCO2-eq person-1 year-1 which is equivalent to approximately 8% of the annual emission of GHG from an average Danish person (including emissions from industry and transport).

A precise control of the number of graphene layers and growth of large homogeneous graphene samples can be achieved. However, as-grown epitaxial graphene on SiC is electron doped due to the influence of the reconstructed interface layer present between graphene and SiC. Covalent bonds between SiC and the first carbon layer grown on top induce a dipole layer which induces charges into the graphene. As a result, the Dirac point energy where the ?-bands cross is shifted away from the Fermi energy, so that the ambipolar properties of graphene cannot be exploited. How this effect can be overcome by a precise control and manipulation of the electronic structure of the ?-bands is demonstrated by two methods. On the one hand, transfer doping of the epitaxial graphene surfaces with the strong acceptor molecule tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) allows for a fine tuning of the doping level. Charge neutrality can be achieved for mono- and bilayer graphene. On bilayer samples the magnitude of the existing bandgap can be increased up to more than double of its initial value. On the other hand, the impact of the SiC-graphene interface can be completely eliminated by annealing the samples in molecular hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms migrate under the graphene layers, intercalate between the SiC substrate and the interface layer and bind to the Si atoms of the SiC(0001) surface. Thus the interface layer, decoupled from the SiC substrate, is turned into a quasi-free standing graphene monolayer. Similarly, epitaxial monolayer graphene turns into a decoupled bilayer.

However, conventional biomass combustion systems produce significant air pollution making them undesirable particularly for public buildings such as schools. Thus, there has been growing interest in advanced wood combustion (AWC) technologies that have higher energy efficiencies and lower emissions. However, achieving increasingly stringent source emission regulations that serve to protect the public health may necessitate the application of pollution control technology on AWC systems. In the present work, the effectiveness of a model electrostatic precipitator (ESP) in capturing the emissions from a 150 kW wood pellet boiler was assessed. Stack gas sampling was performed using the EPA conditional test method CTM-039. Ash resistivity values were estimated using the Bickelhaupt model and measured ash composition, and were found to be consistent with the observed ESP performance. Size-dependent particle collection characteristics of the ESP revealed a slightly reduced collection in the size range of 0.2-1 ?m and was independent of the boiler load. The ESP reduced particle mass to approximately 3 mg/m3 (0 °C, 101.325 kPa, dry gas and 13% O2) representing mass collection efficiencies of approximately 96-98%. It was concluded that ash resistivity would not be problematic for an ESP collecting dust from a typical AWC boiler. © 2010 American Chemical Society."""

Therefore, it is possible to extrapolate the results of artificial ageing to natural ageing conditions. The general form of the equation derived is the same for both investigated the properties of the acid-free paper, in the published article the results of the analysis of both ageing model forms are discussed which are speciafic for each one of these paper strength characteristics. It has been shown that both models differ in absolute values or coefficients identified on the oasis of regression equations. Introducing the numerical values of these coefficients and assuming that the ageing process takes place at the constant temperature 23°C permitted a substantial simplification of the equations, and this made easier to trace the effects of the technological parameters of the acid-free paper manufacture (its composition and the SR pulp slowness) on resistance of the paper to ageing. Using computer graphic analysis of these patterns showed that the decisive influence on the values of the coefficients appearing in the equations, and thus on the resistance to ageing of the acid-free paper, has a beating degree of its pulp. Its effect on the value of the relative reduction in both studied mechanical properties of the acid-free paper manifests itself only after a relatively long time prediction. The lower limit of 95% prediction interval is proposed to adopt for practical applications of the relative value of property changes in the acid-free paper being a result of its natural ageing. Absolute values of the strength of the acid-free paper after a certain time of its ageing depend not only on the relative rate of change but also on the level of its initial value. On the basis of the comparison curves of the minimum of tear resistance values, corresponding to the lower limit of 95% prediction interval, it can be stated that tear resistance values of the acid-free paper will equalise after a relatively long period of its natural ageing, regardless of the initial values of tear resistance. Using the elaborated model, it can be estimated that the studied handsheets of acid-free paper - which technological parameters has deliberately been limited to the area ensuring its high level of resistance to ageing - will retain sufficient strength after a period of at least 1,000 years.

Therefore, for reducing carbon footprint of energy utilization and power generation, it is important to maximize the utilization of these systems. This approach allows minimization of electric energy from less energy efficient systems such as combustion turbines in simple-cycle and steam-turbine systems. When the full potentials of cogeneration and combined-cycle systems have been utilized, simple-cycle combustion systems should be used next because these are, generally, more energy efficient than the steam-turbine based power plants. Unfortunately, during hot weather just when power demand and market value/price of electric energy are high, output capacity of all combustion turbine systems decreases by as much as 30% of the rated capacity (at the ISO temperature of 59F). Hot weather also decreases the energy efficiency of all combustion turbine systems by as much as 5%.

Satellite sensors from Earth Observation deliver spatial information about the crop development. In-field sensors, where available, measure weather conditions. The farmer communicates the applied and planned farming measures to the geo-data service. An agricultural geo-information service integrates all input data, and translates it into advice on what farming measures are required. The recommended measures are delivered to the farmer, who uses satellite navigation for auto-steering and realization of these site-specific farming activities. Farmers will have access to these services in a fully transparent way, requiring little additional effort from their side, and including the possibility of further assistance if necessary. The feasibility of this integrative application of space techniques for precision farming was studied in the frame of ESA's ARTES 20 Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) Programme.

One potential approach toward answering these questions is to fly a reconnaissance mission that utilizes a multi-mode radar in a near-circular low-altitude orbit of approximately 400 km and 60-70° inclination. This type of mission profile results in a total mission delta-V of approximately 4.4 km/s. Aerobraking could provide for a significant portion, potentially up to half, of this energy transfer, thereby permitting more mass to be allocated to the spacecraft and science payload or facilitating the use of smaller, cheaper launch vehicles. Aerobraking at Venus also provides additional science benefits through measurements of upper atmospheric density (recovered from accelerometer data) and temperature values, especially near the terminator where temperature changes are abrupt and constant pressure levels drop dramatically in altitude from day to night. The scientifically rich Venus is also an ideal location to utilize aerobraking techniques. Venus's thick lower atmosphere and slow planet rotation results in more predictable atmospheric densities. The Venus atmosphere has a density variation of 8% compared to Mars' 30% variability. In general, most aerobraking missions try to minimize the duration of the aerobraking phase to keep costs down. These short phases have limited margin to account for contingencies. It is the stable and predictive nature of Venus's atmosphere that provides safer aerobraking opportunities. The nature of aerobraking at Venus provides ideal opportunities to demonstrate aerobraking enhancements and techniques yet to be used at Mars, such as flying a temperature corridor (vs. a heat rate corridor) using a thermal response surface algorithms and autonomous aerobraking, shifting many daily ground activities to onboard the spacecraft. Defining an aerobraking temperature corridor, based on spacecraft component maximum temperatures, can be employed on a spacecraft specifically designed for aerobraking, and will predict subsequent aerobraking orbits and prescribe apoapsis propulsive maneuvers to maintain the spacecraft with its specified temperature limits.

MBR systems typically are constructed on a smaller footprint, and provide superior treated water quality. However, the main drawback of MBR technology is that the permeability of membranes declines during filtration due to membrane fouling, which for a large part causes the high aeration requirements of an MBR to counteract this fouling phenomenon. Due to the complex and still unknown mechanisms of membrane fouling it is neither possible to describe clearly its development by means of a deterministic model, nor to control it with a purely mathematical law. Consequently the majority of MBR applications are controlled in an """"open-loop"""" way i.e. with predefined and fixed air scour and filtration/relaxation or backwashing cycles, and scheduled inline or offline chemical cleaning as a preventive measure, without taking into account the real needs of membrane cleaning based on its filtration performance. However, existing theoretical and empirical knowledge about potential cause-effect relations between a number of factors (influent characteristics, biomass characteristics and operational conditions) and MBR operation can be used to build a knowledgebased decision support system (KB-DSS) for the automatic control of MBRs. This KB-DSS contains a knowledge-based control module, which, based on real time comparison of the current permeability trend with """"reference trends"""", aims at optimizing the operation and energy costs and decreasing fouling rates. In practice the automatic control system proposed regulates the set points of the key operational variables controlled in MBR systems (permeate flux, relaxation and backwash times, backwash flows and times, aeration flow rates, chemical cleaning frequency, waste sludge flow rate and recycle flow rates) and identifies its optimal value. This paper describes the concepts and the 3-level architecture of the knowledge-based DSS and details the knowledge-based control module. Preliminary results of the application of the control module to regulate the air flow rate of an MBR working with variable flux demonstrates the usefulness of this approach. © IWA Publishing 2010."""

Lunar Roving Vehicles (LRVs) were 4-wheeled rovers used on the Moon during the last three missions of the Apollo program in the early 1970s. These vehicles were capable of traversing the lunar surface, allowing the astronauts to extend the range of their surface extravehicular activities (EVA). Furthermore, this invention greatly expanded the range of the lunar explorers. Although, the Lunar Rover proved to be the reliable, safe and flexible vehicle it expected to be, the traversing time of these vehicles was quite long. The rovers had a top speed of about 13 km/h. In addition, the LRV does not have the capability to probe deep valleys. On the other hand they are heavy vehicles. In this paper, as a solution to the mentioned associated problems of LRVs, a novel approach for easy and efficient travel over the moon surface and inside valleys is suggested using jet packs. Jet or rocket packs are various types of device, usually worn on the back, that use jets of escaping gases to allow a single user to fly. The jet can provide significant thrust from fairly lightweight rockets. Application of these devices on Earth has had major drawbacks due to the existence of atmosphere and high gravity acceleration. But these are no more obstacles over the Moon surface. These devices allow an individual to safely travel or leap over short or long distances. The pilot can vector the thrust by altering the direction of the jet nozzles through hand-operated controls. The cylinders of fuel and oxidizer and jet nozzles can be attached to the spacesuit and replaced easily. By the combination of different motions of lever handles the pilot can fly any way. Applicability of typical current jet packs for lunar EVA is assessed in terms of total distance, total time, longest single traverse, maximum range from a lunar module using a simple constant gravity acceleration model neglecting Moon's curvature as well as a minimum energy two-point boundary value Lambert problem. Solutions to this problem revealed outstanding results in terms of travel time per distance traveled and supporting life time efficiency for astronauts. Applicability of this method for inter-colony transportation is also studied considering technological advances."""

The most environmentally and conservation conscious option is to capture these gases for further processing, should that be practical. The recovery and transportation of waste and fugitive gases from offshore operations, however, is both challenging and costly which has resulted in the traditional flaring of these streams. If combustion is deemed most appropriate, the selection of the combustion process can result in very diverse emissions. An example of this is the incineration of tail gas. This yielded an annual fuel savings of over $2MM. The annual reduction of over 73,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent creates a value stream of over $1.1 MM. This is due to the more efficient combustion and the 60% in fuel utilization. Maximizing safety and minimizing GHG and other pollutants and harmful emissions is attributable to high combustion efficiency. While combustion efficiency is a vital part of the overall performance the other critical parameter is reliability. High efficiency and reliability is a result of controlling the environment in which combustion occurs, within the proper operating range and design conditions, while ensuring that all process components have been designed to function prolifically in the marine environment. As a design enhancement, incineration that operates in excess of 99.99% efficiency that can also maximize heat retention will allow the option of recovering that energy as utility to further enhance the overall operating efficiency of the platform. A properly designed waste gas incinerator will provide safe working conditions, superior air quality and contribute to enhanced productivity in an efficient and compliant manner.

Buildings will contain a variety of systems devised by many people, and yet the relationship between buildings and people can only work satisfactorily if there is integration between the supply and demand side stakeholders as well as between the occupants, the systems and the building. Systems thinking is essential in planning, design and management, together with the ability to create and innovate whilst remaining practical. The ultimate objective should be simplicity rather than complexity. This not only requires technical ability but also the powers of interpretation, imagination and even intuition. Building Regulations can stifle creativity but are necessary to set a minimum level of expectation and obey health and safety requirements. However we should aim to design well above these conditions. After all, buildings form our architectural landscape and they, and the environment they generate, should uplift the soul and the spirit of those people within them as well as those who pass by them. The creation of shared visions, effective teams, clear structures and robust processes ensures that the intelligent building being constructed will demonstrate the purpose for which it was conceived. Times are changing as technology and society evolve so there needs to be a long term outlook by the team. Key innovation issues for intelligent buildings include sustainability (energy, water, waste and pollution), the use of information and communication technology, robotics, embedded sensor technology, smart-materials technology including nanotechnology, health in the workplace and social change. Smart materials in facades for example will provide sophisticated forms of feedback and high levels of control besides regulating thermal transmission. Eventually by coating and embedding materials with nano-particles we will be able to specify material properties much more easily. Nanostructure zinc oxide coatings for example can accelerate heat dissipation. Self healing materials will revolutionize facades in the future. Pelletier and Bose (2010) describe how a concrete matrix embedded with capsules of sodium silicate healing agent can repair cracks by the sodium silicate from the ruptured capsules interacting with the calcium hydroxide in the concrete to form a gel which seals the cracks. However innovation must be an enabler rather than an end in itself. Passive environmental design is equally important so that the energy demands are minimized by using natural means such as mass, orientation and building form to capture sunlight, fresh air and rain water. The intelligent buildings control markets are strong worldwide even after the gloomy economic period of 2009. The largest markets are in the US, Asia, Middle East and Europe but some smaller countries are showing rapid growth. BSRIA Member e-News August 2009 shows that Scandinavia, Germany and Qatar spend most per capita on sophisticated intelligent controls. The increasing demand for sustainable, healthy and low carbon intelligent buildings seems likely to sustain this dynamic market. Building management systems provide control and interoperability between the various systems servicing the building. Innovations such as internet-based, common, open communication standards and protocols increasingly make it more important to integrate the systems within intelligent buildings. This in turn will require an extended range of professional expertise that could force a cultural change."""

First, the increment of entropy generally means the increment of complexity, and objects in unstable conditions cause higher entropy variations. Hence, if we apply these properties to the motion segmentation, pixels with large changes in entropy in moments have a higher chance in belonging to moving objects. Therefore, we apply the Clausius Entropy theory to convert the pixel value in an image domain into the amount of energy change in an entropy domain.

Solar H2 production is estimated at a cost in the range of 0.061-0.086 $/kW h, based on its lower heating value and without credit attributed to H2S disposal. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the quench efficiency represents the parameter with the highest impact on the economics of the process. A hybrid natural gas/solar plant design able to operate 24 h-a-day is predicted to reduce the H2 production cost to 0.058 $/kW h at current fuel prices, however, at the expense of increased complexity related with the hybrid reactor design and operation plus the associated CO2 emissions of 0.42 kg/kW h. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the nuclear fuel cycle in the United States today is unsustainable. The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act establishes the U.S. Department of Energy as responsible for disposing of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) generated by commercial nuclear power plants operating in a """"once- through"""" fuel cycle in a deep geologic repository located at Yucca Mountain, NV. However, unyielding political opposition to the Yucca Mountain site has hindered the commissioning process to the extent that the current administration has recently declared the site unsuitable. In light of this, the DOE is exploring other options, including closing the fuel cycle through reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel. The possibility of closing the fuel cycle is receiving special attention because of its ability to minimize the final high level waste package by separating and isolating the most long-lived components, as well as recovering additional energy value from the original fuel. Reprocessing and recycling of SNF can decrease the volume of waste stored by a factor of 4 and reduce the timeframe of storage from hundreds of thousands of years to thousands of years. Reprocessing and recycling technologies are, however, still very controversial because of the increased cost and proliferation risk reprocessing can present. Estimates of increases in the levelized cost of electricity with reprocessing range from about 10% to 50% due to large uncertainties in the financing, construction, and licensing of a new plant. Ultimately, the U.S. will need to compare each of these fuel cycle options with respect to sustainability, proliferation risk, commercial viability, waste management, and energy security to define the future of nuclear power. © 2010 American Institute of Physics."""

With approximately 850 million Mt of steel produced annually worldwide, and employing 859000 people, the steel industry has undergone numerous changes in the last few years. In times of great uncertainty, an understanding of long-term industry trends can help to plot robust strategies. Having winning strategies is very important for a company. Executing these strategies is the key to business. The market has turned really to a buyers market, where 'quality' and 'customer service' are the keywords for survival and steps towards revival of growth in the segment. Presently not only India but whole world is experiencing the meltdown in economic recession while all industries had their ups and downs. Steel, being a commodity, is prone to cyclical downturns and upturns. Changes in business environment call for periodical review of both long and short term plans and setting of new goals by adoption of appropriate strategies. These goals can be achieved by building sustainable competencies based on growth by exploiting fully the potential of available assets, differentiation through quality and service, profitability by excellence in operations and cost reduction, and leveraging the skill and knowledge base of the company's human resources. The challenges that confront Indian steel industry in the age of globalization are complex in nature. The secret of sustainable turnaround lies in how Indian steel industry faces the challenges and develops combative and anticipatory prowess. Problems and solutions may vary with organizations but there is more a commonality than initially meets the eye. The survival strategy provides a foundation, upon which a potent growth strategy could be formulated. While the survival strategy would ensure the survival of the ailing steel industry, the growth strategy would simultaneously take care of its total transformation towards a better future. Both stages, to be implemented through an integrated plan, are essential to enable the industry overcome the present imbroglio. The scenario presented in the paper aimed for both long and short term strategies to achieve growth. The suitable diversified strategy and identified market segments with focus on value-added products close to the core business will be key to success.. The strategy for revival and growth of Indian steel industries with a faster economic growth needs to unlock its full potential. This strength lies in low cost and fairly skilled workforce coupled with faster technological improvement and operational efficiency through better manpower planning, logistics and raw material sourcing along with government help to have cutting edge in steel market at higher output and profit margins. The factors for revival of Indian steel industry are buoyant global steel consumption, buoyant local steel consumption, lower cost of production and adequate rise in price against hike in input costs together with backward integration, consolidation and branded product sales, marketing alliances, etc. The article defines the strategic business processes to frame policy goal, the feasibility of realizing this goal supported with past and projected growth figures of steel through tools like SWOT, PEST etc. The supply side requirements to meet the anticipated demand in terms of availability of critical inputs, infrastructure requirements and current limitations in the country and the need for foreign investment to improve the scenario are highlighted in the article. The strategy suggested for the reversal of the steel industry in India is double layered in nature, effecting the reversal and at the same time sustaining the reversal. The strategy has to be growth and survival oriented. The survival part would assure the survival of the industry in the fierce competitive atmosphere and the growth part would boost the sustainable growth of the industry. The two different parts of the strategy has to be integrated into one to have the expected results. The future concerns and measures regarding the steel price volatility, human resource requirements, R&D requirements, environmental issues, government's role, role of China etc have also been addressed to achieve sustainable growth of Indian steel industry. Industry must develop new technology, improve energy efficiency and unlock more challenging resources. Complete utilization of existing capacities, elimination of bottlenecks in production, along with identification and starting of idle production capacities is also a great challenge in the coming years as the exiting demand to be fulfilled by the existing capacities.

Controller parameterization makes the controller parameters a function of a single variable, the loop-gain bandwidth, and greatly simplifies the tuning process. The controller is scaled according to the gain and frequency scales of the given plant transfer function and the bandwidth parameter whose initial value is set based on the bandwidth requirement from the transient response. This single parameter is required to be gradually adjusted according to a controller performance. However, if the explicit transfer function of a given system is not known, the gain and frequency scales can be determined from an empirical model transfer function obtained from the System Identification procedure.

Pre-surveys and then deepen technical studies and cost and benefit analysis have to be performed. By-products from recycled fibres production lines: rejects from pulping, cleaning, screening represent about 6.5 % of paper production and biological sludge from 0.1 to 0.7 % (of dry matter per ton of paper). Their usual composition (water/plastics/fibres/etc.) and their main characteristics are presented. Their heating values are key parameters that enable to evaluate heat released by their combustion.

Power ranges from 30 thermal MW to 150 thermal MW Nevertheless, this technology requires high-qualified operators because it is more complicated. Dust removal installation from flue gases must be efficient because of a high dust particles generation. In many European paper mills, the volume of rejects produced in paper mills may not be sufficient to operate a by-products incineration plant under cost-effective conditions. That's why most of the time, combustion installations encountered in pulp and paper industry co-fire biomass (wood, bark) with other by-products (sludge, rejects). They usually have a capacity about dozens of MW. (A lot of them generate both steam and electricity). Problems that can occur when operating a boiler burning biomass or by-products are indicated. Investment costs are about 1 -1.5 M€/MW thermal and operation costs are about 30 to 80 k€/ MW thermal/ year or 2 to 4 M€/year.

Grown epitaxially on silicon carbide (SiC) wafers, large area graphene samples appear feasible and integration in existing device technology can be envisioned. This paper reviews the controlled growth of epitaxial graphene layers on SiC(0 0 0 1) and the manipulation of their electronic structure. We show that epitaxial graphene on SiC grows on top of a carbon interface layer that-although it has a graphite-like atomic structure-does not display the linear ?-bands typical for graphene due to a strong covalent bonding to the substrate. Only the second carbon layer on top of this interface acts like monolayer graphene. With a further carbon layer, a graphene bilayer system develops. During the growth of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 0 1) the number of graphene layers can be precisely controlled by monitoring the ?-band structure. Experimental fingerprints for in situ growth control could be established. However, due to the influence of the interface layer, epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 0 1) is intrinsically n-doped and the layers have a long-range corrugation in their density of states. As a result, the Dirac point energy where the ?-bands cross is shifted away from the Fermi energy, so that the ambipolar properties of graphene cannot be exploited. We demonstrate methods to compensate and eliminate this structural and electronic influence of the interface. We show that the band structure of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 0 1) can be precisely tailored by functionalizing the graphene surface with tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) molecules. Charge neutrality can be achieved for mono- and bilayer graphene. On epitaxial bilayer graphene, where a band gap opens due to the asymmetric electric field across the layers imposed by the interface, the magnitude of this band gap can be increased up to more than double its initial value. The hole doping allows the Fermi level to shift into the energy band gap. The impact of the interface layer can be completely eliminated by decoupling the graphene from the SiC substrate by a hydrogen intercalation technique. We demonstrate that hydrogen can migrate under the interface layer and passivate the underlying SiC substrate. The interface layer alone transforms into a quasi-free standing monolayer. Epitaxial monolayer graphene turns into a decoupled bilayer. In combination with atmospheric pressure graphitization, the intercalation process allows the production of quasi-free standing epitaxial graphene on large SiC wafers and represents a highly promising route towards epitaxial graphene based nanoelectronics. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd."""

Replacing the energy-intensive evaporation of stillage by anaerobic digestion is one way of decreasing the energy demand of the lignocellulosic biomass to the ethanol process. The biogas can be upgraded and sold as transportation fuel, injected directly into the gas grid or be incinerated on-site for combined heat and power generation. A techno-economic evaluation of the spruce-to-ethanol process, based on SO2-catalysed steam pretreatment followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, has been performed using the commercial flow-sheeting program Aspen Plus. Various process configurations of anaerobic digestion of the stillage, with different combinations of co-products, have been evaluated in terms of energy efficiency and ethanol production cost versus the reference case of evaporation. Results. Anaerobic digestion of the stillage showed a significantly higher overall energy efficiency (87-92%), based on the lower heating values, than the reference case (81%). Although the amount of ethanol produced was the same in all scenarios, the production cost varied between 4.00 and 5.27 Swedish kronor per litre (0.38-0.50 euro/L), including the reference case. Conclusions. Higher energy efficiency options did not necessarily result in lower ethanol production costs. Anaerobic digestion of the stillage with biogas upgrading was demonstrated to be a favourable option for both energy efficiency and ethanol production cost. The difference in the production cost of ethanol between using the whole stillage or only the liquid fraction in anaerobic digestion was negligible for the combination of co-products including upgraded biogas, electricity and district heat. © 2010 Barta et al"	" licensee BioMed Central Ltd."""

This benchmark, divided into several phases, will cover different operational scenarios which are of importance for the development and operation of commercial nuclear energy systems. The isothermal steady-state forced convection scenario (relevant for this paper) and the non-isothermal natural convection case (not covered by this but by later papers) are the main objects of this investigation. Several benchmark participants (e.g., Seoul National University, ENEA and IPPE) with different code systems simulated the forced convection phase and compared the results. To confirm the calculations, the results were compared to experimental data, obtained from the HELIOS facility (Heavy Eutectic liquid metal Loop for Integral test of Operation and Safety) located at the Seoul National University. The comparison showed that the calculations are within the measurement tolerance but nevertheless discrepancies among the participants exist. Since the natural convection plays an eminent role during accidental scenarios (loss of flow, decay heat removal, etc.), it is important to characterize the loop regarding the local pressures losses caused by geometrical variations (e.g., bends, valves, grids) and the pressure losses due to wall drag as a result of the fluid condition (mass flow rate). The pressure drop estimation is determined by a variety of empirical correlations. Also, for the estimation of the pressure drop across an orifice or in a bend, many different formulas and approaches are available. Hence, it is a logical consequence to apply uncertainty and sensitivity methods to find out which of the parameters are more relevant for the pressure drop prediction. In the frame of this investigation, the system code TRACE and the software system for uncertainty and sensitivity, SUSA, were used. The advantage of this program combination is the possibility to include uncertainties of hard coded functions/correlations inside the TRACE source code. Thus, it is possible to consider values like the density of lead-bismuth or the already mentioned friction loss coefficient. Input values considered in the study are form loss factors for: the orifice, the bends, the valves, the spacer grids. Other input values are the temperature, the mass flow rate and the wall roughness. The results, obtained with TRACE and SUSA, show that the total pressure drop varies between -30 and +15 % related to the reference case.

A new software tool - ToSIA - has been developed for assessing sustainability impacts of Forest-Wood-Chains (FWCs). In the approach, FWCs are defined as chains of production processes (e.g. harvesting-transport-industrial processing), which are linked with products (e.g. a timber frame house). Sustainability is determined by analysing environmental, economic, and social sustainability indicators for all the production processes along the FWC. The tool calculates sustainability values as products of the relative indicator values (i.e. indicator value expressed per unit of material flow) multiplied with the material flow entering the process. Calculated sustainability values are then aggregated for the segments of the FWC or for the complete chain. The sustainability impact assessment requires carefully specified system boundaries. ToSIA uses a data-oriented approach that is very flexible in the focus of the analysis and the selection of indicators of sustainability. An example of alternative Norway spruce management systems in Southern Germany and their effects on six sustainability indicators is presented. The less intensive management system with natural regeneration and motor-manual harvesting shows higher carbon storage and slightly less energy use. It creates more employment and higher labour costs, but the average rate of accidents is also higher.

This is the first time this simple and robust technology has been applied downhole to measure formation fluid viscosity with a wireline formation tester in-situ. Extensive laboratory tests have demonstrated the efficacy of the VW viscometer over a wide range of pressures and temperatures, with tests performed with a large variety of live fluids under flowing or static conditions. Field examples described here were performed in water and oil zones, both in wells drilled with oil-based-mud (OBM) and water-based-mud (WBM). Knowledge of formation fluid characteristics, including viscosity, is important for reservoir characterization. A decision as to the economic viability of a well can depend upon fluid mobility, and, by consequence, its viscosity. Fluid profiling vertically or horizontally provides information on compartments, compositional gradients, thin beds, transition zones, and zonal connectivity. Better understanding of the reservoir using in-situ viscosity measurements can illustrate the origin of compositional gradient, whether it originates from gravity segregation, thermal diffusion, incomplete equilibrium migration, asphaltene precipitation, or biodegradation. The ability to perform in-situ viscosity measurements decreases the need for an extensive sampling campaign and costly and time-consuming pressure/volume/ temperature (PVT) analysis. It helps the operator make real-time decisions for perforation zones and side track drilling. In this article we briefly describe the theory of the VW viscometer and its suitability for downhole measurements. Laboratory results obtained with the sensor at different conditions of pressure and temperature and over a wide range of viscosity are presented. Field results are presented that were obtained during sampling and/or downhole fluid analysis stations for various fluid and mud types, summarized in the examples below: - Oil viscosity in OBM: We present a case of advanced focused sampling (for very low contamination levels) and fluid analysis used to characterize the formation fluid and reservoir, in northern Kuwait. Viscosity measurements were obtained with a high accuracy and compared very well with two other sensors (DV-Rod sensors for in-situ density) that could be used for viscosity measurements in this environment. - Oil viscosity in WBM: The presence of immiscible fluids presents an extra challenge for sensors as the wetting phase may impede proper clean-up of sensor surfaces, thereby biasing the measurement. However, the VW viscometer, of extremely small cross-section, is able to quickly shed itself of debris, mud, and filtrate. In a first example, within 1 hour of sampling the viscosity measurements stabilized to that expected for oil in this reservoir. In the second example with more viscous oil, the measured viscosity of the emulsified fluid decreased as its water content decreased, in agreement with expectations. - Water viscosity in WBM: We discuss formation water viscosity measurements using the VW viscometer. Such measurements allow one to understand the relative mobility of the water and hydrocarbon phases as well as to discriminate between formation and filtrate waters. Downhole viscosity measurements are presented for formation water that are in agreement with their theoretical values at similar conditions. Copyright 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers."""

Materials and methods GaBi 4 software was used to build models to characterize the conventional grid and photovoltaic power generation (corresponding functional unit, 1 kWh). ecoinvent v2.0 was chosen to consider background data. Nine different 2030 scenarios were evaluated versus 2007 reference values to take into account: (a) the progressive change to a greener grid mix in Spain and (b) the improvements in photovoltaic solar technology. Results The results showed that, under the nine considered scenarios for 2030, the CO2-eq.per kilowatt hour emissions are always lower than the reference values for 2007 (reductions around 60%). Additionally, the results showed that 2030 values for the CO 2-eq.per kilowatt hour emissions coming from the use of photovoltaic modules for power generation are expected to be around 60% lower than for 2007 values. Discussion In order to power an electrochemical process, the direct use of photovoltaic solar energy will give much lower CO2-eq.per kilowatt hour emissions than the supply from conventional grid. Conclusions A quantitative study based on life cycle assessment has compared the CO 2-eq.per kilowatt hour emissions coming from supplying an electrochemical reactor by conventional grid and by photovoltaic solar modules under Spanish frame conditions and stated that the novel process photovoltaic solar electrochemical oxidation would be a preferred environmental option due to the lower CO2-eq.per kilowatt hour emissions under present and future scenarios.

Agreement between the experimental data and the mathematical model is sufficient to use the model for scale up. Because of the sometimes poor biomass fuel quality in biomass combustion facilities, the following unfavorable operating conditions occur: fouling and slagging on the furnace and boiler walls.

However, these techniques realize optical interconnection difficultly, which can not be compatible with the mature very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI) technology. One of the key works is to realize a practical light source to satisfy the requirement of optical interconnection.

The device structure adopts n-well and p-sub junction, which n-well is a forked type and is embedded in p-sub.

The models required numerical values for material parameters such as the diffusion coefficient and models were used for adapting values to have a good fit with test results. External heat and mass transfer was a subject for discussion for a long time. Unfortunately, a lot of work was devoted to the surface emission concept, which has turned out to be useless from a practical point of view. Another problem in this field was the apparent deviation from the analogy between heat and mass transfer. Only recently have these external transfer problems been solved, or at least understood. As moisture migration modelling had reached a reasonable level of accuracy, the focus turned towards the calculation of moisture-induced stress. This required modelling of mechanosorptive creep behaviour, which is a subject that is still not fully understood. Initially, only low-temperature, single board models were developed, but gradually other areas were included such as kiln-wide models, energy consumption, drying costs, deformations and temperatures above the boiling point. Areas that still require research and development include modelling free water behaviour in the capillary network, inclusion of sorption hysteresis, environmental impact and modelling discolouration.

Further developing fuel cells in order to reach cost, safety and reliability levels at which their widespread use becomes feasible is an essential prerequisite for the potential establishment of a 'hydrogen economy'. A major factor currently obviating the extensive use of fuel cells is their relatively high costs. At present we estimate these at about 1100 €(2005)/kW for an 80. kW fuel cell system but notice that specific costs vary markedly with fuel cell system power capacity. We analyze past fuel cell cost reductions for both individual manufacturers and the global market. We determine learning curves, with fairly high uncertainty ranges, for three different types of fuel cell technology - AFC, PAFC and PEMFC - each manufactured by a different producer. For PEMFC technology we also calculate a global learning curve, characterised by a learning rate of 21% with an error margin of 4%. Given their respective uncertainties, this global learning rate value is in agreement with those we find for different manufacturers. In contrast to some other new energy technologies, R&D still plays a major role in today's fuel cell improvement process and hence probably explains a substantial part of our observed cost reductions. The remaining share of these cost reductions derives from learning-by-doing proper. Since learning-by-doing usually involves a learning rate of typically 20%, the residual value for pure learning we find for fuel cells is relatively low. In an ideal scenario for fuel cell technology we estimate a bottom-line for specific (80. kW system) manufacturing costs of 95 €(2005)/kW. Although learning curves observed in the past constitute no guarantee for sustained cost reductions in the future, when we assume global total learning at the pace calculated here as the only cost reduction mechanism, this ultimate cost figure is reached after a large-scale deployment about 10 times doubled with respect to the cumulative installed fuel cell capacity to date. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."""

The development and improvement of appropriate mathematical tools will lead to more accurate demand forecasting techniques. In order to forecast the monthly electric power demand per hour in Spain for 2 years, this paper presents a comparison between a new forecasting approach considering vector autoregressive (VAR) forecasting models applied to interval time series (ITS) and the iMLP, the multi-layer perceptron model adapted to interval data. In the proposed comparison, for the VAR approach two models are fitted per every hour, one composed of the centre (mid-point) and radius (half-range), and another one of the lower and upper bounds according to the interval representation assumed by the ITS in the learning set. In the case of the iMLP, only the model composed of the centre and radius is fitted. The other interval representation composed of the lower and upper bounds is obtained from the linear combination of the two. This novel approach, obtaining two bivariate models each hour, makes possible to establish, for different periods in the day, which interval representation is more accurate. Furthermore, the comparison between two different techniques adapted to interval time series allows us to determine the efficiency of these models in forecasting electric power demand. It is important to note that the iMLP technique has been selected for the comparison, as it has shown its accuracy in forecasting daily electricity price intervals.

The network is optimized towards minimizing the energy function that is defined as the measure of the disagreement between the input and output of the network.

Thus mankind has to rely on the alternate/renewable energy sources like biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, etc. On the other hand, suitable waste management strategy is another important aspect of sustainable development. The growth of welfare levels in modern society during the past decades has brought about a huge increase in the production of all kinds of commodities, which indirectly generate waste. Plastics have been one of the materials with the fastest growth because of their wide range of applications due to versatility and relatively low cost. Since the duration of life of plastic products is relatively small, there is a vast plastics waste stream that reaches each year to the final recipients creating a serious environmental problem. Again, because disposal of post consumer plastics is increasingly being constrained by legislation and escalating costs, there is considerable demand for alternatives to disposal or land filling. Advanced research in the field of green chemistry could yield biodegradable/green polymers but is too limited at this point of time to substitute the non-biodegradable plastics in different applications. Once standards are developed for degradable plastics they can be used to evaluate the specific formulations of materials which will find best application in this state as regards their performance and use characteristics. Among the alternatives available are source reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of the inherent energy value through waste-to-energy incineration and processed fuel applications. Production of liquid fuel would be a better alternative as the calorific value of the plastics is comparable to that of fuels, around 40 MJ/kg. Each of these options potentially reduces waste and conserves natural resources. Plastics recycling, continues to progress with a wide range of old and new technologies. Many research projects have been undertaken on chemical recycling of waste plastics to fuel and monomer. This is also reflected by a number of pilot, demonstration, and commercial plants processing various types of plastic wastes in Germany, Japan, USA, India, and elsewhere. Further investigations are required to enhance the generation of value added products (fuel) with low investments without affecting the environment.

At the rate of nowadays consume, reserves will run out of the precious fossil fuel in a short time. The environmental impact of our way of life is tremendous. Society and governments concern the uncertain world we are building and that is why renewable energies are emerging so strongly. Biomass is a promising renewable energy that could replace products, at present, produced by petroleum industry. Biorefinery concept lies on an economically feasible processing to achieve a complete utilization of most of the biomass components. The utilization of agricultural residues as raw materials is a promising alternative to fossil resources for production of energy and high value added products. Pulp/paper industry can be considered as a primitive biorefinery. The drawbacks that this business has to deal with are environmental laws, high energy and water consumption and forest resources scarcity. Facing these weaknesses as challenges, pulp and paper industry could easily become a biorefinery trying to fulfil current environmental demands and competitiveness. The utilisation of assorted lignocellulosic feedstock as agricultural and forestry wastes, the exploitation of different interesting fractions, apart from cellulose, as lignin and hemicelluloses, and the recovery of used solvents can improve the efficiency and profitability of these processes. Organic alcohols and acids have been used in the pulp and paper industry (organosolv technology) and they are gaining new relevance for biomass biorefining as they allow the obtaining of multiple co-products (cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses and extractive components of the lignocellulosic biomass) with versatile uses (Serrano et al., 2010). In the present work, a scheme of a lignocellulosic biorefinery is presented. Among the existent lignocellulosic materials pretreatments, hydrolysis is one of the processes that presents high yield of dissolved hemicellulosic sugars under mild operation conditions. According to the environmental point of view of the biorefinery, organosolv pulping process was considered as the solvent can be easily recovered at the end of the process and the sulphur-free nature allows the obtaining of interesting co-products from the black liquors. The most important substance present in the black liquor is lignin. Lignin fractionation is a promising way to obtain specific molecular weight lignin fractions that can be used to produce high value added products.

The additional risks of unexpected interruptions and mismatch with demand have hindered the expansion of these two primary renewable resources. The goal of this research is to analyze an integrated energy system that includes a novel configuration of wind and solar coupled with two storage methods to make both wind and solar sources dispatchable during peak demand, thereby enabling their broader use. The proposed system utilizes compressed air energy storage (CAES) that is driven from wind energy and thermal storage supplied by concentrated solar thermal power in order to achieve this desired dispatchability. While current CAES facilities use off peak electricity to power their compressors, this system uses power from wind turbines to compress air to high pressure for storage. Also, rather than using natural gas for heating of the compressed air before its expansion through a turbine, which it typical for conventional systems, the system described in this paper replaces the use of natural gas with solar thermal energy and thermal storage. Through a thermodynamic and a levelised lifetime cost analysis we have been able to develop estimates of the power system performance and the cost of energy for this integrated wind-solar-storage system. What we found is that the combination of these components resulted in an efficiency of over 50% for the main power components. We also estimated that the overall system is more expensive per unit of electricity generated than two of the current technologies employed today, namely coal and nuclear, but cheaper than natural gas peaking units. However, this economic analysis, though accurate with regard to the technologies chosen, will not be complete until cost values can be placed on some of the externalities associated with power generation such as fuel cost volatility, national security, and emissions.

As a result, there is an increased attention on the issues of energy security, environmental protections, and sustainable development. In addition, the increase in global energy demands and the desire to reduce damages to the environment motivate a shift to use more renewable energy sources. Biofuels are among the promising forms of renewable energy as it can be produced using a wide variety of feedstocks (e.g. traditional agriculture crops, energy crops, forestry products, municipal solid waste, etc.). Biorefineries are processing facilities that convert biomass into value-added products such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. One of the main research focuses on biorefineries is on individual conversion technology such as thermoconversion and bioconversion. As there is an extensive conversion technologies being established, a systematic optimization approach is required to synthesize the optimum technology pathways for integrated biorefinery design. A technology pathways diagram is first generated by compiling all available technology and their conversion/yield data. The optimization is then formulated as a mixed integral linear programming model to search for optimum network that achieves highest yield.

A comparison of multi-fractured horizontal wells and fishbone wells for tight gas field development is presented in this paper. Multi-fractured horizontal wells have been used to improve oil and gas production from low-permeability reservoirs for over a decade. The problems associated with this type of wells are well productivity decline due to fracture closure with time and uncertainty of fracture propagation due to the lack of knowledge of formation stresses. The disadvantages of multi-fractured horizontal wells may be avoided by using fishbone wells, a new technology developed in the recent years. In this study, we compared the net present values (NPV) of two development plans for a generic gas field using multi-fractured horizontal wells and fishbone wells. We found that these two types of wells can generate comparable NPV values.

The inorganic chlorine substances were then removable by water washing at 1:8 product-water ratio (dry base) and vacuum filtration. MSW blends of various proportions (on %wt), with different rank coal were tested in a Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Combustion characteristics like volatile release, ignition were studied. The result showed that even though the blending of MSW with coal is favorable to initiate the early release of volatile, different ignition behavior was observed depending on the blends composition and coal rank. It is found that the effect of early volatile release by MSW on coal ignition differs and depends on quality of coal. The TGA combustion profiles showed that the combustion characteristics of some of the blends can be predicted from the weighted sum of the blend components.

The detector layer is bonded to an in house designed multi channel application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) which converts the charge to a digital value. Each pixel has its own data acquisition chain and this parallel approach allows both large numbers of photons to be processed and positional information to be determined simultaneously."""

On the other hand, the scientific evidence on the impact of CO2 on the earth's atmosphere calls for immediate actions and would not allow enough time for the global community to ride the 6th technological wave.

Wood and wood-based materials are extensively used as fuel for thermal energy generation particularly in the Brazilian food industry, which demands large amounts of steam. Considering that, sawdust (SD) was also characterized, burned in the same conditions and the gaseous emissions analyzed for comparison purposes. Sampling for the volatile organic compounds benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene (BTEX, expressed as total organic carbon, TOC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were performed and the samples analyzed by gaseous chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Chemical properties showed that the volatile matter value of AB is high (85.36 wt%, daf) what indicates that the solid burn rapidly. The absence of sulfur in its composition represents an advantage in relation to fossil fuels because its combustion does not release sulfur derived compounds. The lower heating value is 21.09 MJ.kg-1 (daf), 26.9% higher than the heating value of SD (16.62 MJ.kg-1). The effect of the N fuel content found in AB composition was clearly noticed through the high NOx concentration in the flue gas resulted from its burning. Comparing the properties and the burning profiles of SD and AB, it can be stated that this industrial waste obtained from the apple juice industry is suitable for direct combustion, constituting a renewable energy source for this industrial sector, however, measures as air staging and staged addition of fuel, or flue gas cleaning technologies would be required for reducing the NOx emission.

Biomass has been considered as a very attractive candidate for green energy carriers, chemicals and materials. The development of cheap and efficient fractionation technology to separate biomass into its main constituents is highly desirable. It enables treatment of each constituent separately, using dedicated conversion technologies to get specific target chemicals. The synergistic combination of aquathermolysis (hot pressurised water treatment) and pyrolysis (thermal degradation in the absence of oxygen) is a promising thermolysis option, integrating fractionation of biomass with production of valuable chemicals. Batch aquathermolysis in an autoclave and subsequent pyrolysis using bubbling fluidised bed reactor technology with beech, poplar, spruce and straw indicate the potential of this hybrid concept to valorise lignocellulosic biomass. Hemicellulose-derived furfural was obtained in yields that ranged from 2 wt% for spruce to 8 wt% for straw. Hydroxymethylfurfural from hemicellulose was obtained in yields from 0.3 wt% for poplar to 3 wt% for spruce. Pyrolysis of the aquathermolised biomass types resulted in 8 wt% (straw) to 11 wt% (spruce) of cellulose-derived levoglucosan. Next to the furfurals and levoglucosan, appreciable amounts of acetic acid were obtained as well from the aquathermolysis step, ranging from 1 wt% for spruce to 5 wt% for straw. To elucidate relations between the chemical changes occurring in the biomass during the integrated process and type and amount of the chemical products formed, a 13C-solid state NMR study has been conducted. Main conclusions are that aquathermolysis results in hemicellulose degradation to lower molecular weight components. Lignin ether bonds are broken, but apart from that, lignin is hardly affected by the aquathermolysis. Cellulose is also retained, although it seems to become more crystalline, probably due to a higher ordering of amorphous cellulose when the samples are cooled down after aquathermolysis. These NMR results are in agreement with thermogravimetric analyses results. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved."""

Energy consumption in low-energy houses, and consequently the heat demand, is even more reduced, for example by 70 % compared to standard level in current regulations. It is envisaged that in new constructions the share of low-energy houses will increase to 50 % by the year 2030 and to 70 % by the year 2050. Tightening energy efficiency requirements are expected to impact technological development. This will lead to a gradual drop exceeding 1 % per annum of specific energy consumption of building stock, including both new constructions and refurbishment. District heating solutions for buildings must be developed at least at the same pace with other megatrends in order for this environment friendly technology to be applicable in the buildings also in the future. The Action Plan for Energy Efficiency published by the European Commission supports efforts to reduce energy consumption in Europe. Building regulations in Finland will soon include considerable cuts of energy consumption. Since year 2010 reduction of 25-30 % of heating load will be required when compared with current regulations. In the year 2012 further cuts will be announced by the Ministry of Environment. In this project, a number of prospective district heating solutions were investigated in the context of buildings needing 75 % less energy as compared with standard solution today. Holistic approach was used, covering the entire system from room space, through the distribution piping, district heating substation to the district heating network. A district heating solution was proposed that fits very low-energy house. A number of different solutions were analysed from the life cycle cost point of view. The most cost-effective district heating solution was based on ventilation integrated heating and domestic hot water system equipped with a storage tank connected through heat exchanger. Conducted analysis suggests that district heating with traditional room heaters and current billing tariff structure may not be cost effective due to high investment costs. Present values (of energy and investments) of all investigated solutions projected over 30 years span remained within the range 0.23-0.33 €/m2 per month. The full load heat pump system was the most expensive and the ventilation integrated heating system using electricity with domestic hot water prepared by heat pump was the least expensive. The apparently narrow range band indicates that in addition to costs also other features should be considered when selecting the energy system.

As much as 8 TLDs were used in each phantom. These TLDs were numbered as TLD 1 to 8 and were placed surrounding the phantom in counter clockwise arrangement. The setup of experimental apparatus was kept the same for every repeated experiment.

The outcome of this study indicates that the Rhizophora spp. wood phantom is an alternative tool to use as a phantom for diagnostic study as it has tissue equivalent features. The dispersion of Rhizophora spp. wood phantom was also found lower in high photon energy (kVp high), suggesting that it can produce optimum dose if applied to body tissues.

Throughout this time there has been a continued need for technical innovation and integration along the value chain. This is becoming ever more apparent, especially when considering the current challenges for the energy industry as a whole, which can be summarised as: 1. Despite the current recession, in the mid to long-term global energy demand will continue to grow 2. Supply of """" easy"""" oil and gas will struggle to keep up 3. Increasing CO2 emissions at a time when climate change is a critical global issue. Although gas resources are relatively abundant, it does not mean they will be easy to develop. There is a need to bring down the increasing cost curve for capital projects. Innovation and technology help to unlock new resources and monetise natural gas that would otherwise not have been considered technically or economically viable. Examples of this include reservoirs located in harsher environments such as Arctic climates or deep water and """"difficult"""" feed gases contaminated with high levels of inert gases and/or sulphur species. The Sakhalin II project is a world-class, export-orientated integrated oil and gas development that includes the construction of Russia's first baseload LNG facility. The complexity of both the process operation and plant construction was increased because of sub-Arctic conditions. Innovative solutions, such as the Dual Mixed Refrigerant (DMR) process that can be optimised for varying ambient temperature, and a jetty that can withstand ice loading, made the project feasible. Continued research into treating difficult feed gases is vital for finding ways to recover sour gas and to utilise it, removing the H2S, CO2 and other undesirable contaminants. With around one-third of the world's gas fields being highly contaminated attention is turning towards developing these more difficult resources. The new technologies being progressed can significantly reduce project development and operating costs for highly contaminated fields. There is demand for technology to monetize gas from different sized gas fields. A range of LNG technologies that are efficient and cost effective at different base load capacities is required. Shell has developed a suite of LNG technology options ranging from 1 mtpa to over 10 mtpa per train. Another aspect that is changing the way LNG projects are developed is the local demand for gas and liquid products. Domestic and regional gas supply is becoming increasingly important and optimal integration with LNG projects is, for some resource holders, a must. All of these developments require a good understanding about the integration of the upstream and midstream processes as well as the demands of the domestic gas market. This paper will provide an overview of innovation across the LNG value chain including examples from projects. Shell's approach to research and development (R &amp"	 D) is discussed, including achieving technology aspirations through collaboration programmes. It is important to remember that technology innovation is not always about step changes in design	 There is also focus on incremental improvements for technology in existing plants to further maximise revenues and reduce operating costs. Applying modern process control and optimisation tools can exploit these opportunities, resulting in several benefits including reduced flaring, running closer to operational constraints and more efficient operations. Issues pertaining to Health, Safety, Security and the Environment (HSSE) are also key LNG project enablers. Efforts are going into reducing the greenhouse gas emissions across the LNG value chain. Examples of this are the application of high efficiency aero-derivative turbines and combined cycle heat &amp	" Power integration. Finally, while innovation is clearly a critical element in achieving improvement it is imperative that risk management methodologies are employed in order to mitigate any potential risks associated with the deployment of a new technology. Shell's approach to HSSE assurance, which ensures that technology entering the market will comply with all applicable standards, will also be addressed."""

This was followed by an asymmetrical load condition that was cycled to limit (or expected operational) loads, ultimate (or maximum design) load, and finally failure. The software predicted the failure locations, and the failure load within 2.1 % of the test failure load. Using PFA load cases were run in sequence, monitoring the start and propagation of damage and updating the local material properties as needed. Nonlinear PFA provides the accuracy of results by the ability to monitor the damage at micro-scale (i.e., honeycomb failure) updating the local material property, initiating fracture in FEM utilizing lamina/laminate analysis to redistribute loading in each laminate layer as damage progresses, and performing global/local analysis to track damage propagation based on the strain energy release rate. Validation utilized the measured load displacement relationship, strain gage measurements, acoustic emissions that were heard during the test, and the final residual strength."""

Photoluminescence spectra of Ce3+ doped BaO-La2O3-B2 O3-SiO2 glasses show an obvious broad band with peak value of about 410 nm, which ascribes to 5d-4f electronic transition of Ce3+ ion. Emission wavelength increases with the reduce of the ratio of boron and silicon reduced in glasses, which can be explained with optical basicity of SiO2 and B2O3. Luminescent intensity of glasses can be enhanced as Ce3+ concentration increases in deoxidization atmosphere. For Ce3+ and Tb3+ co-doped glass, luminescent intensity of Tb3+ decreases, which can be related to the competitive absorption between Ce3+ and Tb3+ when excitation wavelength locates at 200-311 nm. However, the luminescent sensitization of Tb3+ by Ce3+ was observed on the wavelength of 311-444 nm, which is explained with the radiation energy transfer and non-radiation energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+."""

SPATRAM is a multipurpose ultraviolet (UV)-visible scanning spectrometer (250-950 nm). It has been installed at the Observatory of the CGE, in Èvora, since April 2004 and is currently used to carry out measurements of the zenith scattered radiation, the so-called 'Passive mode', to retrieve the vertical content and distribution of some atmospheric tracers such as ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) methodology. The lack of such measurements taken automatically on a routine basis in southwestern European regions, specifically in Portugal, motivated the effort for its installation and constitutes a major driving force for the present work. For continuous NO2 monitoring the 425-455 nm spectral range is investigated. For O3 retrieval the spectral interval 320-340 nm is chosen. The measurements are in good agreement with the photochemical theory of NO2 (O3), showing maximum values during the summer (spring) and minimum values during the winter (autumn) seasons. Moreover, the application of sophisticated inversion schemes to the output of the DOAS program, using the Air Mass Factor (AMF) matrix as the kernel of the inversion algorithm, allowed for the determination of the vertical distribution of NO2 and O3 atmospheric compounds.

The energy conservation and waste heat recovery are paid more attention recently, especially in developing countries, where the energy utilization efficiency is often neglected for accelerating development before energy price is rapidly rising up. In china, the metallurgy industry, cement industry, ceramic industry, glass industry produces a lot of low-grade waste energy which is specially defined as waste gas of low temperature, molten slag of high temperature and the fuel of low LHV (low heating value) in this paper. The recovery rate of this low-grade waste energy is very low in the past. Since the energy is getting exhausted and its price is rapidly growing up, this low-grade energy is going to be recovered more and more by different methods for maintaining sustainable development. This paper tries to give a preliminary overview of the status of low-grade waste energy recovery in China. The low-grade waste energy includes the sensible heat of low-temperature gas from cement kiln, sintering machine, glass smelting furnace, or ceramic kiln, etc. and the chemical heat of low LHV gas from blast furnace and converter. The power generation technology of low-temperature waste recovery has been increasingly applied in cement industry and sintering industry. Although it contains a lot of sensible heat, the hot molten slag, another type of low-grade waste energy, is difficult to extract the applicable energy because of granulation technology limit.

Modern power storage and extraction technologies are based on equilibrium thermodynamic processes, not on the physicochemical nature of the working substances subjected to those processes. Practice and ingenuity guide the complex of the thermophysical and transport properties per application. The development of the JP7 fuel for a special aircraft in the US presents a perfect example [1]. Sustainable energy requires an environment-based approach such as targeting fluids as operational environments with certain optimal points or loci coveting to specific ways of power extraction or transmission. Usage of such intrinsic locations in the fluids would constitute a fundamentally new technology. Retrograde condensation presents such an opportunity. It manifests itself in a pure fluid as a reverse behavior of the vapor quality at a constant specific volume to the left of the critical value. For every specific volume there is only one unique point where the rate of the quality variation with temperature dx/dT changes its sign (from positive to negative). The formula for the locus connecting those points defines the retrograde condensation line. Around each point on this line a limit cycle of evaporation/condensation takes place with the frequency of oscillations depending solely on the properties of substance. These oscillations lead to the associated pressure waves with significant amplitudes depending on the location of the point on the locus. The phenomenon can lead to several energy-related applications with a strikingly different design approach-the adjustment of the device to the substance, its specifics. Here both primary power-generating parameters (pressure amplitude and oscillation frequency) become substance-dependent commensurate to the new requirements of sustainable energy-related designs.

A logical enhancement of EcoBoost technology is the use of E85 for knock mitigation. The subject of this paper is the optimal use of E85 by using two fuel systems in the same EcoBoost engine: port fuel injection (PFI) of gasoline and direct injection (DI) of E85. Gasoline PFI is used for starting and light-medium load operation, while E85 DI is used only as required during high load operation to avoid knock. Direct injection of E85 (a commercially available blend of ~85% ethanol and ~15% gasoline) is extremely effective in suppressing knock, due to ethanol's high inherent octane and its high heat of vaporization, which results in substantial cooling of the charge. As a result, the compression ratio (CR) can be increased and higher boost levels can be used. The increased full load BMEP allows downsizing of the engine at equivalent or enhanced vehicle performance. By enabling higher CR and engine downsizing, the use of E85 DI + gasoline PFI makes the engine more efficient in its use of gasoline, thereby leveraging the effect of the available ethanol in reducing the consumption of gasoline. This leveraging has a profound influence on ethanol's net energy balance and CO2 reduction potential. The vehicle owner will realize high fuel economy because gasoline, with its high heating value per volume, is primarily used for most driving modes in a downsized, high CR engine. In this paper, the concept of E85 DI + gasoline PFI is assessed using a Ford Motor Company 3.5L turbocharged direct injection EcoBoost engine. A PFI system was added to the engine and CR was increased to 12:1. The amount of E85 required to avoid knock was quantified as a function of BMEP at various engine speeds on an engine dynamometer. A full load torque curve subject to the peak pressure and turbine inlet temperature constraints of the engine was also acquired. A vehicle simulation program was then used to quantify the amount of E85 required for various drive cycles, and to determine vehicle fuel consumption. © SAE International 2009."""

The focus of this work is on the supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle which has the potential for both high efficiency, in temperature range (400-750 C), and for reduced capital costs due to very compact turbomachinery1. The cycle achieves high efficiency due to the non-ideal behavior of supercritical CO 2, and it achieves extremely high power density because the fluid in the turbomachinery is very dense, 10%-60% the density of water. Sandia and its contractor Barber Nichols Inc.2 have fabricated and are operating a supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) compression test-loop to investigate the key technology issues associated with this cycle. The compression loop is part of a multi-year phased development program to develop a megawatt (MW) heater-class closed S-CO2 Brayton cycle to demonstrate the applicability of this cycle to heat sources above 400 C. Other portions of the program include modifications to the compression loop to operate it as a simple heated Brayton loop by adding a small turbine and a heater, but with no recuperator. The early testing of this simple Brayton cycle is under way. A more ambitious effort is currently constructing a recompression cycle Brayton loop (1) which is some times called a split-flow Brayton cycle. This cycle is used to increase the efficiency of the system by providing large amounts of recuperation using printed circuit heat exchangers3. The re-compression (or split-flow) Brayton cycle is designed to operate at 1000 F (538 C) and produce up to 250 kWe with a 1.47"""" OD radial compressor and a 2.68"""" OD radial turbine. The current compression loop uses a main compressor that is identical to the main compressors in all the Brayton cycles that are being developed at Sandia. The key issues for the supercritical Brayton cycle include the fundamental issues of compressor fluid performance and system control near the critical point. Near the critical point very non ideal fluid behavior is observed which means that standard tools for analyzing compressor performance cannot be used. Thus one of the goals of the program is to develop data that can be used to validate the tools and models that are used to design the turbomachinery. Other supporting technology issues that are essential to achieving efficiency and cost objectives include bearing type, thrust load and thrust load balancing, bearing cooling, sealing technologies, and rotor windage losses. The current tests are providing the first measurements and information on these important supercritical CO2 power conversion system questions. Some of this data is presented in this report. In the testing to date, the turbomachinery has reached maximum speeds of 65,000 rpm, peak flow rates of over 9 lb/s and pressure ratios of just over 1.65. Compressor inlet fluid densities have been varied from 14% to 70% the density of water. Although the data from these tests are only the first results to be analyzed, they indicate that the basic design and performance predictions are sound. The loops have operated the turbo-compressor on the liquid and vapor side of the saturation curve, very near the critical point, above the critical point and even on the saturation dome. We have also operated the compressor near the choked flow regime and even in surge. At the current operating speeds and pressures, the observed performance map data agrees extremely well with the model predictions. These results have positive implications for the ultimate success of the S-CO2 cycle. In general the main compressor shows no adverse behavior while operating over a wide range of normal operating conditions. It operates reliably and with performance values that are very near the predicted results. Future efforts will focus on operating the Brayton cycle loop at sufficiently high temperatures that electrical power can be produced near the end of 2009. The compression-loop hardware is now the test bed for confirming the remaining parameters to support the next stage of development - which is the 1 MW heater-class split-flow or re-compressor Brayton cycle.

Managed pressure drilling (MPD) is one such solution that can best be described as an adaptive drilling process engineered to safely address exploitation challenges related to reservoir uncertainty issues and cost. MPD is a catchphrase for a whole suite of techniques (including underbalanced drilling UBD) that enhance operational safety, reduce costs, improve reservoir performance and ultimately increase asset value and profitability. MPD delivers economical solutions across the spectrum of drilling operations"	 managing top hole losses and well control problems in vugular carbonates, managing kick-loss challenges in narrow pore pressure/fracture gradient situations, improving production performance in fractured carbonate oil reservoirs, improving rate of penetration and production performance in tight-hard-rock gas reservoirs and enabling real-time dynamic reservoir characterisation and superior drilling and completion decision making. MPD in general relies upon a closed or semi-closed circulating system whereby flow and pressure in the well bore can be precisely controlled, thus enabling a safer, sustainable operation in higher risk environments. The Shell Group has to date deployed MPD overbalanced and MPD underbalanced in over 415 tight gas wells globally. Specifically, Shell has used UBD for dynamic reservoir characterization (RC) on tight gas wells since 2005. The knowledge and insight gained was key to the decision in June 2008 by the global exploration and drilling management teams for the strategic deployment of UBD for RC on all exploration and appraisal tight gas wells. Tight gas exploration plays typically have the following primary objectives	" identify if the reservoir is gas charged, identify if the gas is mobile within the reservoir, identify the flow mechanism and flow units and identify the producible hydrocarbons associated with them. While the gas charge issue can often be determined from static logs and core, the remaining objectives deal with dynamic gas mobility uncertainty. The ability to characterize the reservoir with UBD constitutes a new tool to collect data and reduce project risk for the remaining dynamic gas behavior objectives. Since this decision was taken, UBD-RC has been, or is being deployed on 10 projects in 7 different countries. Shell considers integration of UBD deliverables into the exploration play planning and sub-surface team decision making critical and an area where the operating company must take the lead. This has resulted in optimized equipment specific to tight gas plays to reduce contract services cost and the use of geo-mechanical analyses to validate UBD feasibility and to enhance borehole stability management in a UBD environment. Production from intervals not previously considered productive has been observed and some insight into the behaviour of dual porosity systems has been acquired. This paper outlines the rationale for Shell deploying the technology for dynamic RCand the lessons learned in applications to date.

SCW NPPs will have much higher operating parameters compared to current NPPs (i.e., steam pressures of about 25 MPa and steam outlet temperatures up to 625°C). Additionally, SCWRs will have a simplified flow circuit in which steam generators, steam dryers, steam separators, etc. will be eliminated. Furthermore, SCWRs operating at higher temperatures can facilitate an economical co-generation of hydrogen through thermo-chemical cycles (particularly, the copper-chlorine cycle) or direct high-temperature electrolysis. To decrease significantly the development costs of a SCW NPP, to increase its reliability, and to achieve similar high thermal efficiencies as the advanced fossil steam cycles it should be determined whether SCW NPPs can be designed with a steam-cycle arrangement that closely matches that of mature SuperCritical (SC) fossil-fired thermal power plants (including their SC-turbine technology).

The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9.5%, and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation of approximately 4%. The differences between LED and INC cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of """"mesopic luminance"""" data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i.e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38% more efficient than the INC cap lamp with a lead-acid battery at the end of the 10-h driving cycle. Lastly, accelerated life tests were used to empirically determine light output depreciation as the INC light source age approached its useful life. There was about a 35% decrease in light output. This is quite considerable, particularly given that the light output will decrease an additional 30% to 45% over the period of a 10-h shift. The implications of the differences between LED and INC sources are discussed. This information is crucial in determining how visual performance could be affected for real-world conditions where batteries discharge during the work shift and as the light source ages. To date, only idealized conditions have been used for LED and INC cap lamp visual performance research. © 2009 IEEE."""

In this paper, recent progress in the recycling and recovery of PSW is reviewed. A special emphasis is paid on waste generated from polyolefinic sources, which makes up a great percentage of our daily single-life cycle plastic products. The four routes of PSW treatment are detailed and discussed covering primary (re-extrusion), secondary (mechanical), tertiary (chemical) and quaternary (energy recovery) schemes and technologies. Primary recycling, which involves the re-introduction of clean scrap of single polymer to the extrusion cycle in order to produce products of the similar material, is commonly applied in the processing line itself but rarely applied among recyclers, as recycling materials rarely possess the required quality. The various waste products, consisting of either end-of-life or production (scrap) waste, are the feedstock of secondary techniques, thereby generally reduced in size to a more desirable shape and form, such as pellets, flakes or powders, depending on the source, shape and usability. Tertiary treatment schemes have contributed greatly to the recycling status of PSW in recent years. Advanced thermo-chemical treatment methods cover a wide range of technologies and produce either fuels or petrochemical feedstock. Nowadays, non-catalytic thermal cracking (thermolysis) is receiving renewed attention, due to the fact of added value on a crude oil barrel and its very valuable yielded products. But a fact remains that advanced thermo-chemical recycling of PSW (namely polyolefins) still lacks the proper design and kinetic background to target certain desired products and/or chemicals. Energy recovery was found to be an attainable solution to PSW in general and municipal solid waste (MSW) in particular. The amount of energy produced in kilns and reactors applied in this route is sufficiently investigated up to the point of operation, but not in terms of integration with either petrochemical or converting plants. Although primary and secondary recycling schemes are well established and widely applied, it is concluded that many of the PSW tertiary and quaternary treatment schemes appear to be robust and worthy of additional investigation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd."""

The O-H ?-bond activation of methanol occurs with small activation barrier (E a) of 7.1 (14.6) kcal/mol and large exothermicity (Eexo) of 65.8 (61.4) kcal/mol to afford (Me3SiO)2Ti(OCH 3)[NH(SiMe3)], indicating that the O-H ?-bond activation occurs easier than the C-H ?-bond activation (Ea = 14.6 (21.5) kcal/mol and Eexo = 22.7 (16.5) kcal/mol), where DFT- and MP4(SDQ)-calculated values are presented without and in parenthesis hereafter. Though the OCH3 group becomes anionic and the H atom becomes proton-like in this activation reaction, population changes more moderately occur than those of the C-H ?-bond activation.

This is because the Ti-H bond energy is much larger than the Ti-SiH3 one.

The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability.

Design/methodology/approach - The nylon-12 coated carbon steel powders were prepared by the dissolution-precipitation process. The powder characteristics are examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and laser diffraction particle size analysis. The effect of the applied laser energy density on the three-point bend strength and dimensional accuracy of the SLS specimens are studied. The influence of nylon-12 content on the bend strength are also investigated. Findings - The SEM and laser diffraction particle size analysis results indicate that the steel particles are well coated by nylon-12 resin. The bend strength of the SLS specimens increases with increasing the applied energy density until it reaches a maximum value, and then further increasing energy density will cause the decrease in the bend strength. The bend strength of the SLS specimens increases with increasing the nylon-12 content over the investigated range. The dimensional errors in the ITX/IT-ITY/IT-and ITZ/IT-directions are all increased with the increase in energy density.

[1, 2] The pyrolysis of soft woods, in particular spruce and pine, has emerged as a credible alternative to bio-digestive strategies that are reliant on fermentation processes, typically of corn feedstocks. The design objectives for the micro-reactor system are reviewed, highlighting the multi-physics and multidisciplinary complexity in designing for transient characterization of the pyrolized products by the micro- reactor system. One of the dominant challenges in the des"	"gn of the micro-reactor for fast pyrolysis reactions is the requirement of very high heating rates for the feedstock, on the order of 100°C/s. A 1 D transient thermal model of the reactor is developed that considers the average particle size and morphology, the initial surface temperature of the reaction surface within the micro- reactor, the heat loss to the ambient atmosphere in the reactor, the heat loss through the contact resistance between the sample and the reaction surface and the thermal capacitance of the reaction surface. A parametric evaluation of the design space was performed using the 1 D model in order to identify a preferred range of particle size, reactor surface area and thermal input power. Based on the results for the domain reduction study, multi-physics thermo-mechanical 3D FEA was used to undertake a brute-force optimization process of the final design. The key metric considered in the FEA study was the maximum thermal gradient in the reaction surface and was driven to a minimum value. The thermal response of the prototype micro-reactor has been evaluated using infra-red thermography measurement techniques. Thermographical analysis of the results has demonstrated negligible thermal gradients in the reaction plane up to the maximum reaction setpoint of 450°C.

These barriers increasingly shift from the technical to the economic and institutional. The most general types of barriers are due to technological 'lock-out' or to carbon 'lock-in' [Unruh, G., 2000. Understanding carbon lock-in. Energy Policy 28(12), 817-830 (Elsevier)]. These barriers necessitate the development of a strategic approach to deploy or introduce renewable energy technology. Existing energy policy has mostly relied upon financial subsidies, market-based instruments such as renewable portfolio standards, and production tax credits to stimulate the installation and use of equipment to generate electricity from renewable sources. These strategies target mostly system-level decisions of end users. The purpose of this paper is to present an innovation perspective on the renewable energy deployment process by introducing the innovation value-added chain (IVC) framework. The analytical objective of IVC is to evaluate the impact of a new innovation on the various stakeholders and players in the development and deployment processes. A deployment or innovation strategy that causes minimal disruption, enhances existing competencies, or expedites new learning by the players has a higher chance to succeed. We draw upon two sets of system integration costs data for grid-connected distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems in Japan and the United States and demonstrate conspicuously different dynamic learning behaviors. These two deployment models can be understood in terms of how the IVCs are organized and how PV system integration projects are performed in the field. In addition, IVC-based findings can inform the targeted application of conventional financial subsidies for learning investment not only at the PV system level, but also at the (localized) system integration level. This would involve other stakeholders, thus suggesting new energy policy space. We highlight some future research directions using the IVC framework. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, to implement higher added value products, besides mitigate environmental problems caused by deforestation, the use of natural gas by the sector seems to be a promising alternative.

In this study, fry-drying technology with a high heat transfer coefficient of approximately 500 W/m2 °C was used to dry industrial wastewater sludge. Also waste oil was used in the fry-drying process, and because the oil's boiling point is between 240 and 340 °C and the specific heat is approximately 60% of that of water.

After approximately 10 min, the water content of the sludge was less than 10%, and its heating value surpassed 5300 kcal/kg. Indeed, this makes the organic sludge appropriate for use as a solid fuel. The wastewater sludge used in this study was the designated waste discharged from chemical, leather and plating plants. These samples varied in characteristics, especially with regard to heavy metal concentration.

These differences were reduced by adjusting the reported elemental compositions which were applied to the modified Dulong model. However, not all the predictions were accurate and the Shafizadeh model was modified to give accurate predictions for biomass wastes, except for processed or non -carbohydrate polymerized materials. Accuracy improved when 'Hess Law' was applied to determine 'energy of formation', which was found to be inversely proportional to bomb calorimeter values. A further refinement was made with 'formation coefficients' which gave very accurate experimental values.

Environmental and economic concerns have yet to be fully reconciled. One view is that decisions that incorporate both society's concern with the environment and investors' desire for shareholder value maximization are more likely to be truly sustainable. We coin the term dual sustainability to mean the achievement of environmental and financial sustainability simultaneously. Many experts believe that wind energy can help to meet society's needs without harming future generations. It is clean and renewable. Because the fuel is free it provides the ultimate in energy independence. Wind energy has emerged as a leading prospect, in part, because it is considered by many to be environmentally sustainable. However, a key question that remains is whether wind energy is financially sustainable without the extensive government support that has helped to create and nurture this growth industry. Using reliable, proprietary data from field research, our analysis employs a capital budgeting framework to evaluate the financial economics of investments in wind energy. We find that because of the convergence of improved technology, greater efficiency, and with the increasing cost of traditional, competing sources such as oil and natural gas, wind energy is close to becoming self-sustaining financially without the extensive federal government support that exists today. Wind energy can provide the best of both worlds. It is sustainable from an environmental perspective and it is becoming sustainable financially. In short, those companies investing in wind energy will be able to do well by doing good. Perhaps the achievement of dual sustainability is true sustainability. Our research findings and dual sustainability have several interesting and important implications for public policy towards wind energy.

The history of alternative fuels has not been very successful. Various economic, social, and technological barriers have impeded the acceptance of energy carriers such as hydrogen as a major transportation fuel. An effective interaction between the societal system of vehicle owners and a supply infrastructure of alternative fuels is needed for mass adoption of these future technologies. However, hydrogen due to its production pathways, particularly from renewable resources, inexhaustible, and clean nature, an ubiquitous presence and its promise of a sustainable transportable energy source give it a strong edge to be fuel of the future. This paper discusses the economical, social, and technological implications on the use of hydrogen as a future transport fuel. Furthermore, three cases based on UK Department of Transport studies showing the penetration of high efficiency vehicles, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), and hydrogen fuel internal combustion engine vehicles (H 2-ICEs) into the future transport fleet are discussed. With some assumptions, it indicates clearly that by the end of 2050 the H2-ICEs will play a major role in the UK transport sector whereas more time is needed for FCVs due to their less compelling consumer value possibility. Also, it can be inferred that the emissions from hydrogen's full life cycle are about half those of the direct emissions from nonrenewable fuels such as the natural gas from which it is produced, thereby showing a promising future of hydrogen fuel to cope with the problem of climate change and the continuously increasing scarcity of conventional/fossil fuels.

The water flows from the CRU can be directed to the evaporator side of the EDAHP as the low-grade heat source. The water flows from the condensation side of the EDAHP, in conjunction with the jacket water flows from the JRU, is used for heating. In the summer, the exhaust gas from the ICE is used to drive the EDAHP for cooling directly, the exhaust gas from the EDAHP is bypassed to the exit via automated damper controls. The waste heat of the jacket water is used to drive the liquid desiccant dehumidification systems, to realize the separate control of heat and humidity. The automated damper is used in order to test various configurations and operating modes. The testing results show that the operating parameters and efficiencies of the overall system depend on different configurations. Under certain combinations of CCHP, the efficiency of the overall system can be as high as 90% (based on lower heating value of the natural gas). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."""

In this setting, the decision to invest in energy-saving technology can be delayed, providing option value.

CO2 emission control is also complicated by the need to provide SO2 and NOx emission control as well. Burner modifications can be used to control NOx, but other scrubbing technologies are needed to control SO2 emissions. For high sulfur coals, limestone scrubbing is generally applied, adding to the cost of power through purchases of limestone reagent and disposal of by-product gypsum. Cansolv has evolved amine based regenerable technologies that capture SO2 and CO2 and that release them in a water wet, nearly pure condition. SO2 can be converted to sulfuric acid and CO2 can be dried, compressed and sequestered without further treatment. Most importantly, energy used to capture SO2 can be recycled to help capture CO2, reducing the net energy demand of the CO2 process. The use of these two technologies together allows power companies to use higher sulfur, lower cost fuels and reduce energy consumption rates for CO2 capture.

The inter-channel noise dispersion and mean baseline variation is less than 8% and 0.5%, respectively. The spread in the gain between different channels is found to be 1.5%. Energy resolution of 16.5% at 511 keV and 12.8% at 662 keV has been measured. Timing measurements between the two APDs that readout the same crystal is extracted and compared with detailed Monte Carlo simulations.

As energy usage is one of the key cost drivers in data centers, workload consolidation is increasingly used to host multiple applications on a single server, sharing and multiplexing a server's capacity over time. To minimize the number of required, energyconsuming servers, IT managers need to decide which applications should be combined on which server. For that purpose, typically application workload levels are predicted for a planning period such as a month in a defined granularity (e.g., over 5-minute intervals). Then integer programs are used to minimize the amount of required servers, while for each interval constraints ensure that the aggregated workloads of applications assigned to a server must not exceed a server's capacity. As such problems are NP-hard and computationally intractable for data centers with hundreds of servers and fine-grained workload data, approximations are applied to find at least a good solution, often abandoning the chance to find the optimum. In this paper we propose a novel approach based on applying Singular Value Decomposition to the workload data to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by capturing workload features in order to make the problem computationally tractable. We interpret the coordinates of the time-series projections along the first right singular vectors as indicators for workload levels and complementarities and propose a model to solve the consolidation problem with these few indicators only.

The focus of this work is on the supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle which has the potential for high efficiency, and for reduced capital costs due to very compact turbomachinery. Sandia has fabricated and is operating a supercritical CO2 (SCO2) test loop to investigate the key technology issues associated with this cycle. This loop is part of a multi-year phased development program to develop a megawatt (MW) class closed SCO2 Brayton cycle to demonstrate the applicability of this cycle for DOE Gen-IV program. The current loop has been configured as both a compression loop and as simple heated but unrecuperated Brayton cycle. A second split-flow or re-compression Brayton cycle is currently under development that will use approximately 1 MW of heat to run the Brayton cycle. Early configurations of this split-flow Brayton cycle will be operational later this fiscal year. The key issues for this cycle include the fundamental issues of compressor fluid performance and system control near the critical point, but also the supporting technology issues of bearings, sealing technologies, and rotor windage losses which are also essential to achieving efficiency and cost objectives. These tests are providing the first measurements and information on these key supercritical CO2 power conversion systems questions. Important data for all these issues has been obtained. This report presents the major results of the testing by showing and comparing the measured compressor performance map with the predicted performance. The compression loop uses a ?50 kWe motor driven compressor to spin a 37 mm OD compressor at design speeds up to 75,000 rpm with a pressure ratio of 1.8 and a flow rate of 3.53 kg/s for a compressor inlet condition of 305.3 K and 7690 kPa.

It is based on a 3D finite elements method. The thermophysical properties of the PET are assumed independent of temperature while the internal radiative intensity absorption is taken as one-dimensional and is governed by the Beer-Lambert law. To avoid the difficult problem of computing the shape factors, a semi-analytical approach is used. Finally, the numerical simulations have allowed to validate the analytical and experimental results. In the first place, we have written the energy conservation equation in absence of convection (based on the first law of thermodynamics) (1.a), the radiative source term (1.b) and the boundary conditions (2). As for the finite elements method, the Galerkin approach is used for the formulation of the 3D heat transfer equation (3) and the diagonalisation of the heat capacity matrix, """"lumped matrix"""", is adopted [M.A. Dokainish, K. Subbaraj, A survey of direct time-integration methods in computational structural dynamics, Comput. Struct. 32 (6) (1989) 1371-1386]. A single step implicit time integration scheme is used for the computation [M.A. Dokainish, K. Subbaraj, A survey of direct time-integration methods in computational structural dynamics, Comput. Struct. 32 (6) (1989) 1371-1386]. After recalling the classical expressions for the radiative flux divergence (5) and the flux itself (6), we have rewritten the radiative source term for an homogeneous medium as a function of spectral intensity (7) and given the integro-differential equation of radiative transfer [R. Siegel, J.R. Howel, Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer, Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, Washington, 1992], Eq. (8). The spectral relations linking coefficients of extinction, absorption, scattering and scattering albedo are given by Eqs. (9) and (10), while Eq. (11) expresses the boundary conditions. In the second place, on the basis of the non-scattering behaviour of amorphous PET [K. Esser, E. Haberstroh, U. Hüsgen, D. Weinand, Infrared radiation in the processing of plastics: Precise adjustment-the key to productivity, Adv. Polymer Technol. 7 (2) (1987) 89-128"	 M.D. Shelby, Effects of infrared lamp temperature and other variables on the reheat rate of PET, in: Proceedings of ANTEC'91 Conference, 1991, pp. 1420-1424	 G. Venkateswaran, M.R. Cameron, S.A. Jabarin, Effect of temperature profiles trough preform thickness on the properties of reheat-blown PET containers, Adv. Polymer Technol. 17 (3) (1997) 237-249], we have assumed that extinction and absorption coefficients are equal, the corresponding albedo being zero. The radiative transfer equation can thus be rewritten in a reduced form (12). Moreover, for the temperature range prevailing in the processes of PET thermoforming and preforms blowing, temperatures of radiation sources are generally much higher than those used for the forming of these thermoplastic media. Under these conditions, the cold medium hypothesis is used [Y. Le Maoult, F.M. Schmidt, V. Laborde, M. El Hafi, P. Lebaudy, Measurement and calculation of perform infrared heating: a first approach, in: Proceeedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Advanced Infrared, 1997, pp. 321-331], which allows to express transmission of spectral intensity across the material as a function of position and direction (13), and to write the radiative flux divergence in a simplified form as well (14). For one-dimensional radiation, solution of the radiative transfer equation [R. Siegel, J.R. Howel, Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer, Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, Washington, 1992] is given by Eq. (15), which combines with Eq. (14) to yield the spectral flux generated inside the semi-transparent medium, Eq. (16). In case of radiation propagation in the same direction as the normal to the polymeric membrane surface, radiation intensity can then be expressed by the Beer-Lambert law (17). This permits to deduce the expression of spectral flux transmitted across the PET membrane thickness (18). Infrared radiation intercepted by the membrane. For determining the infrared radiation intercepted by the membrane surface, the medium between the radiation source and the thermoplastic material is assumed to be completely transparent to radiation. It is also assumed that the surface of the source is diffuse. This allows to infer, from spectral expressions of the energy emitted by the source (Eqs. (19) and (20)) and of the energy received by the semi-transparent membrane (Eq. (21)), a relation for radiation intercepted by the surface at all wavelengths (Eqs. (22) and (23)). For an isotropically radiating source (Lambertian source) when considering an average emissivity of the heating source, Eq. (24), total radiation intercepted by the surface is given by Eq. (25). Infrared radiation absorbed by the membrane. For the determination of infrared radiation absorbed by the polymeric membrane, first, based on the principle of energy conservation, spectral relation (27) which links reflectivity, absorptivity and transmissivity is recalled, as well as relation (28) associating spectral absorption and transmission coefficients following the Beer-Lambert law. Consequently, this allows to find the spectral energy absorbed by the semi-transparent medium (29) with the aid of Eq. (25). Concentrating on wavelength bands that constitute the transmission spectrum of the medium, Eq. (29) is then replaced by Eq. (30) where average values of reflectivity (31) and transmissivity (32) are considered. As a result, the volumetric total energy absorbed by the medium, the flux divergence, is then given by Eqs. (33) and (34). Furthermore, considering that reflectivity is low for polymeric materials (generally lower than 5%), the latter is neglected leading to Eq. (35) instead of Eq. (34). Fig. 1 illustrates a typical transmissivity curve for PET [G. Venkateswaran, M.R. Cameron, S.A. Jabarin, Effect of temperature profiles trough preform thickness on the properties of reheat-blown PET containers, Adv. Polymer Technol. 17 (3) (1997) 237-249]. Shape factor. In order to take into account arbitrary shapes of sources and preforms, a semi-analytical approach is used for the computation of shape factors [G. Venkateswaran, M.R. Cameron, S.A. Jabarin, Effect of temperature profiles trough preform thickness on the properties of reheat-blown PET containers, Adv. Polymer Technol. 17 (3) (1997) 237-249]. The definition of shape factor is recalled in Eq. (36) and Fig. 2. An equivalent form based on the contour principle [R. Rammohan, Efficient evaluation of diffuse view factors for radiation, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer. 39 (1996) 1281-1286] is given by Eq. (37), while the semi-analytical formula [F. Erchiqui, N.G. Dituba, Analyse comparative des méthodes de calcul des facteurs de formes pour des surfaces à contours rectilignes, Internat. J. Thermal Sci. 46 (2007) 284-293] is expressed by Eq. (39). Validation of this semi-analytical approach is obtained by comparison with the analytical solution [H.C. Hottel, Radiant heat transmission between surfaces separated by non-absorbing media, Trans. ASME 53 (1931) 265-273, FSP-53-196	 A. Feingold, Radiant-interchange configuration factors between various selected plane surfaces, Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 292 (1996) 51-60	" J.R. Ehlert, T.F. Smith, View factors for perpendicular and parallel rectangular plates, J. Thermophys. Heat Trans. 7 (1993) 173-174] as well as with results yielded by three different techniques, i.e. the area-integration method, the Gauss quadratic technique and the contour method. Table 1 summarizes the numerical results obtained in each case and gives the relative error. Analytical validation of the reheating. Regarding the numerical validation, we have considered a PET semi infinite medium subjected to a uniform incident radiative flux density. The boundaries of the semi transparent medium are taken as adiabatic. Thermophysical properties and geometrics are given in Table 2. The one-dimensional Laplace equation which governs the radiation heat transfer is solved analytically with the aid of Laplace transforms. The temperature evolution within the depth of the semi transparent medium is obtained by analytical solution [A.B. De Vriendt, in: G. Morin, (Ed.), La transmission de la chaleur, vol. 1, Chicoutimi, Québec, 1984], Eq. (40). Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the numerical solution obtained by the 3D finite elements method and the analytical one. It is seen that, for the three cases, the relative error between numerical and analytical results stays lower than 0.1%. Numerical modeling of infrared heating. An amorphous PET sheet is considered. The face of the membrane is a square of side 20 cm with a thickness of 1.5 mm. The lateral walls are assumed adiabatic. For modeling with the 3D finite elements method, the sheet is meshed with identical hexahedra comprising eight nodes. The thermophysical properties used for this study are given in [S. Monteix, F. Schmidt, Y. Le Maoult, R Ben Yedder, R.W. Diraddo, D. Laroche, Experimental study and numerical simulation of perform or sheet exposed to infrared radiative heating, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 119 (2001) 90-97] and the reheating time is 35 seconds. The heat transfer coefficient h on front and rear faces is 10 W m-2 K-1. Heat flux received by the polymer during heating. To estimate the incident heat flux distribution on the surface of the polymer, we first calculate the shape factors between each pair of emitting/receiving surfaces. Then the flux distribution is obtained with Eq. (25). Fig. 4 illustrates this distribution. Validation against experimental results."""

The present paper describes the performance of LED and incandescent sources in cap lamps in terms of correlated color temperature, color rendering, light output, electric power, ambient temperature and airflow, and light source aging. Importantly, these characteristics can influence a miner's ability to spot mining hazards thus impacting safety. Secondly, some of these characteristics interact with the operating life of the cap lamp's battery power, such that differences between LED and incandescent sources can be magnified toward the end of a 10-hour battery discharge cycle. Empirically, we have determined that after 8 hours at an ambient temperature of 25 °C, the average light output of an incandescent cap lamp can decrease to about 69% of its initial value when powered by a lead-acid battery and it can decrease to about 65% of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. An LED-based cap lamp using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96% of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9.5% and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation of approximately 4%. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of """"mesopic luminance"""" data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i.e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery at the end of the 10-hour driving cycle. Lastly, accelerated life tests were used to empirically determine light output depreciation as the incandescent light source age approached its useful life. There was about a 35% decrease in light output. This is quite considerable, especially given that the light output will decrease an additional 30% to 45% over the period of a 10-hour shift. The implications of the differences between LED and incandescent sources are discussed. This information is crucial in determining how visual performance could be affected for real-world conditions where batteries discharge during the work shift and as the light source ages.

The availability of the maximum possible number of parallel emergency and voice calls during a disaster is ensured when the Operation & Maintenance Center reconfigures the network in accordance with a pre-defined emergency plan via a smart SW package. This also guarantees minimized power consumption by the basestations. The nature of the actual threat determines how the network has to be configured.

The composition, crystalline structure and hardness of the as-deposited coatings were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nanoindentation experiments. The abrasion wear resistance of the TiAlN coatings was measured by a micro-abrasion tester with the presence of SiC water-based slurry with a concentration of 0.35 g/cm3. It was found that with increasing the Al/Ti atomic ratio the hardness of the as-deposited TiAlN coatings initially increased up to a maximum value of about 40 GPa at around Al/Ti = 1.22, and then the coating hardness decreased rapidly with increasing aluminium content further. The abrasion wear resistance of the TiAlN coatings is evidently better, with one order of magnitude lower in the wear rate, than the bare HSS substrate. With increasing Al/Ti atomic ratio, the variation trend of the abrasion wear rate of the TiAlN coatings is generally opposite to that of coating hardness. This means the abrasion wear resistance of the TiAlN PVD hard coatings is predominately determined by the hardness of the coating materials. It was also noted that, besides the coating hardness, the composition of the TiAlN coatings also plays an important role in determining their abrasive wear resistance. The coatings in the higher Al content range (Al/Ti ? 1.60) exhibited an evident better abrasive wear resistance than those in the lower aluminium content range (Al/Ti ? 0.32) when their hardness is similar. This fact could be related to the finer microstructure of the coatings incorporated with higher aluminium content. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."""

Its current configuration includes eleven solar-powered buoy-monitored locations with physical and optical sensors, four shore-based long-range HF radar systems for surface current measurement, operational circulation and wave models, satellite observations, inshore nutrient monitoring, and hourly web-delivery of data. It serves a broad array of real-time oceanographic and marine meteorological data and data products to scientists, state and federal regulators, the National Weather Service, both the US and Canadian Coast Guards, the National Data Buoy Center, educators, regional naturalresource managers, the Gulf of Maine fishing and maritime industries, local airports and airlines, sailors, and the general public. The ocean observing system that can be thought of as consisting of four major subsystems: the data acquisition subsystem"	 the data handling, processing, and archiving subsystem	 the system of numerical nowcast and forecast models	" and a web-based data distribution/presentation subsystem. The Gulf of Maine is a harsh operational environment. Winter storms pose severe challenges including the build up of sea ice on buoy, its solar panels, and its meteorological sensors. In summer the productive waters of the gulf can present severe biofouling problems that affect the operation of optical sensors. Thus, the periods of most difficult field operations coincide with the periods of greatest data value in terms of marine safety, search and rescue, and the monitoring biological productivity. Never-the-less, the data returns for the GoMOOS ocean sensor array has averaged approximately 90% over the first seven years of operation. This unusually high rate of data return is due in large part to our operational six-month duty/maintenance cycle on all equipment. We have 22 buoys for 11 locations, and 22 complete sets of instrumentation that are rotated in and out of service on a six month schedule. The challenges of the Gulf of Maine physical environment were largely understood a priori, and were incorporated into the system design criteria and the blueprints for the service and maintenance protocols. However, there were unanticipated challenges in the funding process that have caused the greatest difficulties, and which continue to pose a serious threat to continued operation and success of this ocean observing system, as well as others observing systems in the United States. Funding for the system has been chronically short and subject to the unpredictable fluctuations of a US congressional appropriations process. The inadequacy and variability of funding has substantially hampered the operations of many of the Integrated Ocean Observing Systems (IOOS), including GoMOOS, and has hindered technological improvements. The funding crisis has deepened to the point that, unless this trend is quickly reversed, the number of monitoring stations will be substantially reduced and system will no longer be able to serve many of citizens, organizations, and agencies that have come to rely upon the data it currently provides. Ocean sensors, ocean platform technologies, and modeling and visualization techniques are in a period of rapid technical development. If stable funding can be achieved, the capabilities of operational ocean observing systems could increase dramatically over the next decade. Autonomous vehicles could become the fast response survey fleet of the IOOS, as well as taking on routine, sustained marine survey functions that are already prohibitively expensive to perform using ships, and will become even more costly as energy costs rise in the future. Practical autonomous vehicles will likely expand beyond gliders and AUVs to include surface sail vessels and energy-efficient autonomous aerial drones. The combination of time series measurements from profiling packages on buoy arrays with the repeatedly spatial surveys of the autonomous fleets will provide a new look at our coastal oceans that could transform coastal ocean science and management. Coupled with these new platform advances will be significant growth in the areas of real-time biochemical sensors, sensor miniaturization, high-speed data telemetry technologies, increases in onboard data processing capabilities, routine two-way communications with submerged sensors, and advances in data visualization techniques that will amount to virtual presence. The single greatest enabling factor of these broad improvements to ocean observing operations and science appears, at present, to be the establishment of an adequate, stable, and predictable funding process. © 2008 IEEE."""

The shifting plates put the earth's crust under extreme stress, which has a propensity to cause various difficult drilling conditions including: • Faults • High pore pressure • Wellbore instability These issues are difficult to predict, both in occurrence and true vertical depth (TVD), and are usually mitigated by running an unplanned string of casing. Unexpected conditions requiring a casing point put the drilling plan at risk when reservoir objectives are hole-size dependent. Standard oil country tubular goods (OCTG) reduce the wellbore inside diameter (ID) every time a casing string is set. When the situation dictates setting casing higher than planned, solid expandable technology has successfully minimized wellbore reduction and enabled the operator to get back to the casing program with an optimized hole size. Planning solid expandable systems into wellbore construction as a design element, rather than a contingency plan, has averted numerous problems identified during the drilling process. Conventional solid expandable systems minimize loss of hole size, while single-diameter expandable systems (including openhole cladding) provide solutions without loss of hole size. By utilizing single-diameter technology, zones and formations can be sealed, allowing the next hole section to be drilled with the same bit as the previous. In this capacity, expandable systems become an enabling technology for previously undrillable wells.

Using the framework, the comparative advantages of nuclear energy along with the counteracting implications of some problematic issues have been demonstrated in integrated studies carried out for a variety of countries. Current nuclear energy, operating under conditions prevailing in most industrialised countries, exhibits favourable economic performance in terms of production costs and low sensitivity to fuel price increases.

Technological developments towards reactor designs which assure both strong limitations to the consequences of hypothetically severe nuclear accidents, as well as radical reductions in the necessary waste confinement times, opens the possibility of improving the social criteria performance of nuclear power which have currently a negative affect on its overall sustainability ranking."""

It is a continuously developing area because of its necessity and because of the strict rules of the European Union but at present there doesn't exist any better alternative of the shredder technology. The automobile shredder is a highly automatised waste-processing machine with a capacity over 100.000 t/y, that disintegrates the wrecks. At the entrance of this machine the feed materials are car bodies, mixed scrap, scrap bales, and on the other side arrives separately the output materials: shredded iron, ferrous and non-ferrous metal, and mixed non-metals: rubber, glass, plastics. The name of the last fraction is shredder light fraction (SLF) with high calorific value. This technology could be found on the market, however the issue of shredder light fraction needs increased development because of the strict expectations of environment protection. The majority of the output materials that is about 76-82% of the processed quantity considered as utilizable, and the rest non-metal (SLF) 18-22% means the problematical part. There are two kinds of technologies for residue utilization: material recovery (e.g. Volkswagen SiCon, MBA Polymers, Delft Univ.) and energy recovery (e.g. pirolysis). It can be stated that according to the recommendations in the directives of the European Union the material recovery is more preferred than the energy recovery. In addition it supports that even me car raw materials should be reusable and recyclable. Since there does not exist any reliable method for the separation of the material mixture of this problematic fraction known as SLF, it would be highly suggested to make extra efforts to develop such technologies. In the last few years several studies were made in this subject that underpin that among plastics utilized in vehicles only the material of the bumpers mean such size and quantity of material that can be reused economically in its ordinary aim - after pre-dismantling. In the regard of all the other components of the vehicle the demand of the living labour expenses and the separation (after shredding) technology development expenses had made these experimentations uneconomical.

The most promising technologies for CCS are: oxy-fuel (O-F) combustion, pre-combustion capture, and post-combustion capture. This paper discusses the recent work conducted by Siemens Power Generation, Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) and Clean Energy Systems, Inc. (CES) in adapting high temperature gas turbines to use CES's drive gases in high-efficiency O-F zero emission power plants (ZEPPs). CES's O-F cycle features high-pressure combustion of fuel with oxygen (O2) in the presence of recycled coolant (water, steam or CO 2) to produce drive gases composed predominantly of steam and CO 2. This cycle provides the unique capability to capture nearly pure CO2 and trace by-products by simple condensation of the steam.An attractive O-F power cycle uses high, intermediate and low pressure turbines (HPT, IPT and LPT, respectively). The HPT may be based on either current commercial or advanced steam turbine technology. Low pressure steam turbine technology is readily applicable to the LPT. To achieve high efficiencies, an IPT is necessary and efficiency increases with inlet temperature. The high-temperature IPT's necessitate advanced turbine materials and cooling technology. O-F plants have an abundance of water, cool steam ?200°C (400°F) and CO2 that can be used as cooling fluids within the combustor and IPT systems. For the """"First Generation"""" ZEPP, a General Electric J79 turbine, minus the compressor, to be driven directly by CES's 170 MW, high-pressure oxy-fuel combustor (gas generator), has been adapted. A modest inlet gas temperature of 760°C (MOOT) was selected to eliminate the need for turbine cooling. The J79 turbine operating on natural gas delivers 32 MWe and incorporates a single-stage free-turbine that generates an additional 11 MWe. When an HPT and an LPT are added, the net output power (accounting for losses) becomes 60 MWe at 30% efficiency based on lower heating value (LHV), including the parasitic loads for O2 separation and compression and for CO2 capture and compression to 151.5 bar (2200 psia). For an inlet temperature of 927°C (1700°F), the nominal value, the net output power is 70 MWe at 34% efficiency (LHV). FTT and CES are evaluating a """"Second Generation"""" IPT with a gas inlet temperature of 1260°C (2300°F).

The research investigated L-PC, L-GGBS and PC-GGBS blends to assess their potential for application in sustainable unfired clay building materials (bricks, mortar, etc.). Use of unfired materials reduces not only energy costs, but also environmental damage associated with the traditional firing process used in the manufacture of clay building components. Due to the high strength requirements of the building industry compared with, for example, stabilised highway pavement layers, a high maximum stabiliser dosage of 20% was used. For road construction, typical stabiliser dosages are 3-8% for lime and 3-5% for PC. In the current investigation, cylindrical test specimens were cured for 28 days at moisture contents of 25, 30, 35 and 40% before testing for unconfined compressive strength. Preliminary results show that the strength values for all stabilised material investigated was within the strength range of 737-2077 kN/m2 at 28 days, with L-PC blends tending to achieve lower strength values than L-GGBS blends.

In this regard, materials are of utmost significance since the choice of materials greatly influences, among other things, recyclability. Recycled materials from end-of-life vehicles are important resources for the production of secondary products and the generation of energy. This fact acquires vital implications since the prices of primary raw materials on world markets have seen a huge upsurge over the last few years. The legal requirements for the recycling of end-of-life vehicles derive from the European Directive on End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV). This directive also defines legal standards for recycling quotas of ELVs. In order to fulfil these quotas manual dismantling of plastic parts has been the strategy which was followed in the past. Component-specific requirements have been defined for vehicle design in order to get a recycling optimized product. However, manual dismantling offers no economical or ecological benefits in comparison to large scale sorting technologies which have witnessed very intensive development. Since these technologies are applied after the shredding process they are summarised under the term """"post shredder technology"""" (PST). These technologies have reached a highly sophisticated level which allows a reorientation in the design for recycling of a car no longer considering manual dismantling of plastic components. Are these technologies also suitable for current vehicles which will reach their end of life after 15 to 20 years? To respond to this question, the BMW Group conducted a large-scale recycling trial with 501 BMW prototypes. The complete recycling process beginning from vehicle assessment up to material recycling and recovery was investigated. Therefore, an existing PST from the Scholz company in Germany representing the latest state-of-the-art technology was used for this trial. The plastics resulting from this process were separated by the Galloo Plastic S. A. facilities in France. The plastics passed through various modified sink-float facilities to obtain reusable plastic fractions. The results of the large-scale BMW trial have proven the suitability of PST as well as the plastic separation process with regard to compliance with the European legal obligations in the ELV Directive. It is possible to separate nearly completely metals directly and/or after further processing of metal-containing components. The plastics from the plastic-rubber composite fractions were separated on an industrial scale to produce PP, PE, PS, ABS and talc-filled concentrates as secondary raw materials. In addition, plastics were recycled as reducing agents for the blast furnace. High heat value fractions were recovered, usable for energy recovery operations, e. g. in the cement industry. Therefore, the PST established the basis for future recycling processes of ELVs. This is of particular importance since nowadays ELVs are a significant source of raw materials. This trend is predicted to continue due to rising raw material prices."""

From the technological point of view, using pure hydrogen as fuel seems highly restrictive because hydrogen with high purity may not always be readily available. As an attractive alternative to compressed hydrogen, it is preferred to use hydrogen-rich gases as fuel. On-site generation of hydrogen using reformed fuels can be directly fed to the high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) without first preheating the cell with external heat source to raise the temperature to its operating temperature. Since the HT-PEMFCs performance depends strongly on temperature, the cell temperature plays an important role in its operation. The purpose of this research is to experimentally study a high temperature PEM fuel cell at steady operating conditions. In this work, the performance of the fuel cell has been experimentally examined to unravel the steady-state effects of changes in temperature and pressure at a fixed hydrogen stoichiometry and variable air stiochiometries In particular, the effects that changes in temperature and pressure have on the voltage-current characteristics.

HFCS was widely embraced by food formulators, and its use grew between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s, principally as a replacement for sucrose. This was primarily because of its sweetness comparable with that of sucrose, improved stability and functionality, and ease of use.

The machine makes extensive use of superconducting technology for magnets, busbars and current leads. It is built in a circular tunnel of 27 km circumference, ready to receive proton beams in the summer of 2008. In case of a resistive transition (quench) in a superconducting magnet or busbar of a LHC corrector circuit, a time window of maximum 60 ms is given for the detection of the quench and the activation of the energy extraction (EE) system, after which the risk of overheating may seriously affect the integrity of the circuit. Fast and reliable extraction of the stored energy (up to 150 kJ) is needed to prevent such damage caused by local dissipation of the energy stored in the magnet chain. For reasons of redundancy the energy extraction breakers were designed with multiple and independent release systems for deviation of the magnet excitation current into energy absorbing resistors (series-inserted system). For all 600 A DC circuits of the LHC, which have external energy extraction, electro-mechanical switch gear, fast enough to eliminate the risk of thermal damage, was chosen. Opening breakers with two independent release systems were especially developed in collaboration with Russian industry. Because of the high inductance of the circuits, varying from 12 to 1200 mH, capacitors were introduced to assist the commutation process and minimize the arc, herewith reducing the opening time and increasing the lifetime of the breaker contacts. The total opening time is typically 18 ms giving a comfortable margin to the design value. The complete extraction system is powered, controlled and supervised by in-house made integrated electronics, embedded firmware and controls software. The first corrector magnet circuits with external energy extraction have been successfully commissioned.

These components include the Blanket and the Divertor that will operate at temperatures, heat loads and neutron flux higher than that of reached in a nuclear fission power plant reactor. Among others, one of the main critical issues of the ITER reactor is the transfer of the heat generated in the Plasma, during the D-T reaction, through the Tokamak Cooling Water System (TCWS), to the intermediated closed loop Component Cooling Water System (CCWS) and then, via the open loop Heat Rejection System (HRS) to the environment. The HRS also absorbs heat through the CCWS from other non nuclear systems like the Chilled Water System (CHWS), the Cryogenic System, the Steady State Electrical Power Network (SSEPN) and other auxiliary systems. The HRS rejects to the environment all the heats from the ITER components (nuclear and non nuclear) with the only exception the Vacuum Vessel whose heat are released via a separate primary heat transfer system to the air coolers.

Thin film technologies and concentration systems are viable ways to reducing cost, with unique strengths and weakness for both. Most of the concentrating PV work focuses on high concentration systems for reducing energy cost.

This paper analyzes the relative benefit of asymmetric vs. symmetric optics for low-concentrators in light of specific PV applications. Approach: Symmetric and asymmetric concentrating PV module performance is evaluated using computer simulation to determine potential value across various geographic locations and applications. The selected optic design is modeled against standard cSi flat panels and thin film to determine application fit, system level energy density and economic value. Results: While symmetric designs may seem ideal, asymmetric designs have an advantage in energy density. Both designs are assessed for aperture, optimum concentration ratio, and ideal system array configuration. Analysis of performance across climate specific effects (diffuse, direct and circumsolar) and location specific effects (sunpath) are also presented. The energy density and energy production of low concentrators provide a compelling value proposition.

One crucial task is to understand how DBMS can benefit from such hardware. That is to identify which database operations are beneficial to be offloaded given a query workload in a particular setting. For certain operations, we establish value proposition via various approaches and show the analytical and experimental results. In particular, star join queries are commonly used in business warehouses. We propose to offload a portion of a starjoin query from host to the POWERS P processors on a storage server, which dramatically reduces the amount of channel IO and host CPU consumption. Moreover, the query elapsed time is improved via the exploitation of the state-of-the-art P processors on a storage server. © 2008 IEEE."""

In particular we focus on 'ultra-lean' combustion, where the methane concentration is actually at or below the lean flammability limit for a free flame (5% methane by volume in air). Porous burners are an advanced combustion technology whereby a premixed fuel/air mixture burns within the cavities of a solid porous matrix. They are capable of burning low-calorific value fuels and very lean fuel/air mixtures that would not normally be flammable, potentially allowing the exploitation of what would otherwise be wasted energy resources. Possible lean-burn applications include the reburn of exhaust gases from existing combustion systems, and the mitigation of fugitive methane emissions. Porous burners operate on the principle that the solid porous matrix serves as a means of recirculating heat from the hot combustion products to the incoming reactants. This results in burning velocities higher than those for a free flame, as well as extended lean flammability limits. Burner performance is also characterised by low emissions of combustion related pollutants and stable operation over a wide range of fuel concentrations and flow rates. Stable combustion of methane/air mixtures below the conventional lean limit has been observed by a number of researchers"	" in one study the combustion of a mixture with a fuel concentration of only 1% was reported. A number of design considerations are important as regards optimising burner performance for lean-burn applications. Foremost among these is the selection of a suitable material for the porous matrix. Possibilities include packed beds of alumina spheres or saddles, and reticulated foams made of silicon carbide or high temperature metal alloys. Other potentially significant design issues include the length of the porous bed, the use of 'multi-section' designs where different porous materials are used in each section, the incorporation of external heat exchangers to supplement the heat recirculation provided by the porous matrix, and the ability to operate the burner at elevated pressures. There is an extensive body of research relating to porous burners, comprising experimental and numerical investigations. However the majority of previous studies have been directed towards the use of porous burners for radiant heating applications rather than for the combustion of low-calorific value fuels. Consequently there is a lack of reliable data relating specifically to ultra-lean combustion. We identify specific areas where further research is required to progress this field. These include the influence on burner performance of the design considerations listed above, the stability of the combustion process to fluctuations in fuel concentration and flow rate, the development of reliable models specifically for ultra-lean combustion in practical burners, and the investigation of issues relating to scale-up and commercial application. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a novel preprocessing system that performs two critical tasks concurrently in a translation-invariant wavelet transform domain. These tasks include enhancement of snore signals via a level-correlation-dependent (LCD) threshold, and identification of snore presence through a snore activity (SA) detector. Various experiments were conducted to warrant the robustness of the system in terms of theoretical statistics quality, signal-to-noise ratio, mean opinion score, and clinical usefulness in detecting OSA. Results indicate that the proposed LCD threshold and SA detector are highly comparable to the existing denoising methodologies using level-dependent threshold and segmentation approaches using short-time energy and zero-crossing rate, yielding the best results in all the experiments.

Both the STR and the METI's technology roadmapping effectiveness have been widely valued in R&D society. In addition, Japan could be a world leading country on eco-innovation, because of its historical experience on environment and energy-saving. METI developed a new area of sustainable manufacturing technology in the STR and will present it to the global basis. METI has actively involved itself in technology roadmapping for recent years to build broad discussion basis for researchers and business-oriented people in academia, industry and government. METI decided to develop its technology roadmaps in various areas in order to illustrate future industry opportunities and reasonable ways for technology to be developed. We call the roadmaps as the STR. The STR consists of 1) The Scenario for Dissemination that includes relevant policies that should be dealt with in order to provide the public with findings of R&D as products and services, 2) Technology Overview in which Prioritized critical technologies are described in addition to technological challenges, elemental technologies, and desired functions in order to satisfy market and social needs, and 3) The Roadmap in which improvement and progress of elemental technologies generated from R&D, and the enhancement of the desired functions are displayed on a time axis as milestones. Also, a reference and summary containing the main ideas are attached. METI has been continuing effort to utilize technology roadmapping in the course of R&D management. This map is arranged systematically and strategically with an enormous amount of technical information regarding industrial technology. It is believed that it will be of benefit in terms of information provision for both industry and related scientific groups to unearth new research and engineering development themes, and for the continuing creation of new intellectual property. As a step toward the construction of a national innovation system, MITI continues to make an attempt to smoothen communication among industry, academia and government through this roadmapping process. A total of approximately 550 members from industrial, academic, and public institutions were involved to study and discuss the STR as a member of task forces. And METI decided the STR to be revised every year in principle. Last spring, METI released forth version of the STR entitled """"the STR 2008"""" as a result of successive efforts. The newest version, STR 2008, covers 30 fields of industry technology which include a new area of sustainable manufacturing technology. Japan could be a world leading country on eco-innovation, because of its historical experience on environment and energy-saving. For example, Japanese industry has reduced its energy consumption to around half of 30 years ago. Also, Japan could serve as the best partner to collaborate with other countries to negotiate continuing economic growth while alleviating global warming and other global issues. In Japan, now, lots of academies and companies utilize the STR and embrace their own technology roadmapping activities as communication initiatives outside and inside of interdisciplinary R&D projects. Some small and medium-sized enterprises quote the STR to their own strategic business roadmaps. The STR is referred in the discussion process of actual R&D projects in many ways, not only for evaluating the progress of specific projects, but also for discussing future expansion of application, etc. In addition, the process of making the STR is a highly valuable tool for nurturing communication in various ways: among researchers, between researchers and businesspersons, among different players in value chains, and between scientists and engineers, etc. The technology roadmapping is not a """"magic wand"""" of innovation mechanism, but many people in the R&D management in Japan have become aware of its usefulness and effectiveness if it is properly developed and used."""

Today's fuels are dominated by crude oil derived fuels. In Europe currently 98% of the road transportation is based on such crude oil derived fuels. Similar ratios can be observed e.g. in the US and other countries. In addition to the environmental impacts, the high dependency on the imports of fossil fuels motivates most European countries to investigate in other than fossil fuel based transport systems. Therefore the European Commission presented an action plan including a strategy with the objective to substitute 20% of crude oil derived fuels by alternative fuel until 2020. To achieve these goals, actions to reduce the import dependency of fuels, the usage of non renewable (fossil) resources and the environmental burdens connected to the use of fuel/propulsion systems have to be addressed. Besides, the energy carrier mix has to be broadened. Especially alternative fuels from renewable resources, BtL (Biomass to Liquid) are supposed to have a high potential. Recent developments show, that there is a variety of options for fuels available as well as for propulsion technologies that utilize fuels based on renewable resources. It is therefore of key importance to select and promote the fuel/propulsion system technology which is most beneficiary for a country or region from an environmental but also from an economic and social perspective. For such a sustainability evaluation it is essential to consider the local/regional boundary conditions such as availability of fuel resources, major pollution issues which need to be addressed, supply of secondary energy (e.g. power) etc. LCA is therefore a suitable approach to evaluate and compare different options, due to its transparent consideration of all life cycle stages. Besides the environmental impacts and resource consumption which are addressed in LCA considerations the needed land is another important aspect when talking about biomass as a resource. As land is a scarce resource that is used for all industry sectors there is a need to address this issue also in LCA. Up to now, no commonly agreed upon methods exist which allow the integration of land use aspects in a consistent way into LCA Software and Database. Currently at LBP-GaBi, University of Stuttgart together with PE International, a method is developed to integrate land use aspects into LCA. Backward processes are now implemented in an applicable way into a LCA database system.

Nuclear power is part of the solution. For electricity supply, as exemplified in Finland and France, the EPR brings an immediate answer. Should uranium resources get tight or should a new management of minor actinides be required, a deployment of Fast Neutron Reactors would be needed. For other supply, mostly heat, the High Temperature Reactor (HTR) brings a solution inaccessible to conventional nuclear power plants for high, or even in the longer term very high temperature. HTR fuel is compatible with an industrial scheme encompassing light water reactors, fuel recycling and Fast Reactors. As fossil fuels costs increase and efforts to avoid generation of greenhouse gases are implemented, a market for nuclear generated process heat will be developed. After an active development phase in the 80's, HTR has been put on the back burner. Several commercial projects are now again actively promoted worldwide. AREVA is convinced that HTR is not in competition with large LWRs for electricity generation, but that its actual added value is its potential for addressing cogeneration and industrial process heat production. Therefore AREVA launched in 2004 the ANTARES programme for a pre-conceptual design study, with the support of EDF and together with a large R&D programme needed for the design in close collaboration with CEA. The pre-conceptual phase was finalised end of 2006. The specific feature of AREVA's concept, which distinguishes it from other ones, is its indirect cycle design powering a combined cycle power plant. Several reasons support this design choice, one of the most important being the design flexibility to adapt readily to combined heat and power applications, with a standardised nuclear heat source as independent as possible of the versatile process heat applications with which it is coupled. Standardisation should expedite licensing. In view of the volatility of the costs of fossil fuels, AREVA's choice brings to the large industrial heat applications the fuel cost predictability of nuclear fuel with the efficiency of a high temperature heat source free of greenhouse gases emissions. The reactor module produces 600 MWth which can be split into the required process heat, the remaining power driving an adapted prorated electric plant. Depending on the process heat temperature and power needs, up to 80 % of the nuclear heat is converted into useful energy. The essential conditions for success include: Timely adapted licensing process and regulations, codes and standards for such application and design, An industry oriented R&D program to meet the technological challenges making the best use of international collaboration, of which the Generation IV International Forum could be the vector, Identification of an end user (or a consortium of end users) ready to take the challenge for a first industrial application."""

The value of IC technology is explored in this early deployment which saw a relatively low cost application targeted towards a mature asset. The beneficial results of this application of IC technology were measured in terms of well intervention cost savings and affected oil production. This paper presents a relative comparison of those benefits. Though this application of IC technology was originally justified by the avoidance of certain future well interventions to modify the injection profile, an analysis of the affected pattern production in the post-installation period showed that the benefit to the operator was appreciably more from enhanced reservoir management than from the cost savings which were associated with workover avoidance. Based on the success described in this case history, and reflecting upon the trends of intelligent well and smart field technology, the authors explore reasons for its relatively slow uptake in moderate production rate, brownfield applications. Large scale reservoir management of miscible flood projects using intelligent well and smart field technologies should provide significant value in terms of improved solvent/oil ratio through more efficient monitoring and management of the flood. This is probably the most compelling value proposition for IC technology application in moderate production rate land applications. This case history is intended to provide credible evidence of the benefit of IC technology in an application with cost challenges analogous to those faced by operators who are responsible for cost sensitive, moderate production assets. Secondly, it is intended to encourage the IC technology providers to develop more solutions for the brownfield segment of the industry, where profitability and value definition can be challenging.

Integrated Operations cover all aspects of business activities from Exploration to Drilling to Production though this discussion will focus on the Drilling aspects. For ConocoPhillips Norway (COPNo.) to employ this technology there has been a need to re-organize operations, to investigate new work processes and a need to establish a willingness to share information. According to a study by the Cambridge Energy Research Associates in 2003', the increased use of new and emerging digital technologies could potentially boost world oil reserves by 125 billion barrels over the next 5 years. Petoro A.S. of Norway has estimated the added value of applying eField and Integrated Operations (IO) on the Norwegian Continental Shelf to be NOK 150 billion 2. A more recent report by the OLF (Norwegian Oil Industry Association) indicates that the value of IO to Norway could be NOK 250 billion 3. In summary, industry studies indicate that the potential benefits of IO are significant. Five key digital technologies will substantially improve the oil industry's ability to see reserves more clearly, plan optimal drilling and production strategies and manage operations more efficiently. They are: a. Remote sensing b. Visualization c. Intelligent drilling and completions d. Automation, and e. Data integration.

This study presents an approach where a hybrid optimization technique based on genetic algorithm (GA) and a Neuro-Fuzzy system as proxy was created and used to determine the optimal well locations regarding net present value (NPV) maximization as the objective. Neuro-Fuzzy system was used as proxy to decrease the numbers of costly and time consuming-simulations. Such a system has supplanted a conventional technology in some scientific applications and engineering systems, especially in modeling nonlinear systems. Neuro-Fuzzy modeling is a flexible framework, in which different paradigms can be combined, providing, on the one hand, a transparent interface with the designer and, on the other hand, a tool for accurate nonlinear modeling. The rule-based character of Neuro-Fuzzy models allows for the analysis and interpretation of the result. Within Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA), a database of the completed simulations is made. This database is used to construct of Neuro-Fuzzy network. Then this network is used to estimate the fitness function at points that no simulations have not been done. This proxy is also able to get better during the optimization each time a new point is verified and visited points database is updated. A synthetic reservoir was tested and comparisons made among HGA, simple GA and non-proxy using approaches. Results showed that Neuro-Fuzzy system is very reliable proxy to estimate fitness function so the HGA will have a good chance to obtain the optimal place for the well in minimum possible duration.

Much has been written about the application of these technologies and steps to successful installation of the hardware. But the real value of intelligent wells and smart field systems come from the ongoing exploitation of the new technology in day to day operations. This paper compares the methods of reservoir surveillance and production optimisation in the """"old world"""" to those of the next generation intelligent fields. Successful exploitation of the new technologies requires an understanding of information flow, control and automation capabilities, knowledge management, interpersonal communications, and decision processes to develop performance indicators, workflows, philosophies and protocols suitable for the fields of the future. Three core elements are explored in the intelligent field workflow: the reservoir management philosophy, the production surveillance capabilities, and the operating guidelines. The requisite components of these elements are reviewed in the context of intelligent field capabilities. The concept of intelligent well and intelligent field optimization is explored examining the most recent developments in proxy modeling and feed-forward control technologies applied to well and reservoir management. The value of these new optimisation tools will come not just from fine tuning of steady state conditions, but more likely from being able to react quickly to changes in operating conditions, whether reservoir, well or facilities related, to find optimum production solutions in near real time. The concepts discussed in this paper are applicable to all intelligent well and smart field applications, particularly to those planning to implement """"real-time"""" reservoir optimisation strategies.

The Oil & Gas industry has recognised the potential of operating with 'normally unmanned areas' where access to the entire process is based on utilisation of new technologies from remote onshore locations. During maintenance, personnel have only got restricted access when the process is shut-down, but this is primarily handled remotely. This paper concerns teleoperation and telepresence of oil & gas installations. The challenges involve more than the technology of transferring data and performing operations. A teleoperator or a telerobot is a """"machine"""" which extends a human operator's sensing and manipulation capability to a remote environment. An essential issue of telepresence is to keep the human operators in the control loop to enable them to use their high levels of skill to complement the power of remote manipulators. Teleoperation within oil & gas differs from other known applications as offshore installations represent large, complex and dynamic processes located hundreds of miles away in very harsh environments where failures may result in major consequences for the environment and process equipment. The challenges of offshore teleoperation are to enhance the operator's perception of the current situation so that the operator has a complete understanding of state of the process and operates the process as if he was offshore without hundreds of miles and complex technology in between. Safe and efficient teleoperation is critical for operation of unmanned platforms to secure added value and optimal production within a distant environment.

These """"warn and seek shelter"""" mechanisms have clearly reduced the loss of life and, to a lesser extent, property damage associated with these natural events. However, despite our best efforts, loss of life and costly property damage are still strongly associated with severe weather phenomenon. This paper describes concepts that use either ground or space based platforms for generating beams of microwave radiation to provide localized thermal heating or ionization of the atmosphere. It is further suggested that these heating techniques could initially be used as research tools for improving computer simulations of atmospheric phenomena. The ultimate goal is to utilize such tools for prevention of severe storm phenomena and eventually for the manipulation of the jet stream for alleviation of draught and floods. The experimental techniques include a) heating of rain droplets with microwaves between 26 and 35 Ghz, b) Heating of atmospheric oxygen with microwave frequencies of about 54 Ghz and c) creation of artificial ionization plasma patterns in the atmosphere which can be heated with microwaves to produce acoustic or gravitational waves and can interact with electrical phenomena by adjustments in atmospheric electrical conductivity. New experimental techniques similar to """"ink drop"""" experiments to determine the diffusion of chemicals in a liquid can be applied to the atmosphere to study heat transport and electrical properties. Weather research concepts are discussed. The microwave heating technologies suggested in this paper provide methods for rapidly heating well-defined regions of a weather system. Ground or satellite based microwave phased arrays, focused on specific locations in the atmosphere, will be used to heat the atmosphere and to create useful artificial ionized plasma patterns. Initial experiments would correlate heating in a specific region of a weather system with computer simulations. Weather modification of tornadoes and of the jet stream is also discussed. One such application is to prevent concentration of rotational energy in a mesocyclone by heating the cold rainy downdrafts. The anticipated result is to prevent the precise rotation geometry that can produce a tornado and thus interrupt tornado formation. Methods of influencing the jet stream are also discussed.

Measured transmission values were compared with Monte Carlo calculated transmission data using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code to score fluence in a geometry similar to that of the measurements. The results indicate that the RMI457 Solid Water, CMNC Plastic Water and PTW RW3 solid phantoms had similar transmission values as compared to water to within ± 1.5 %. However, Perspex had a greater deviation in the transmission values up to ± 4 %. The agreement between the measured and EGSnrc calculated transmission values agreed to within ± 1 % over the range of phantom thickness studied. The linear attenuation coefficients at the gamma ray energy of 140.5 keV were determined from the measured and EGSnrc calculated transmission data and compared with predicted values derived from data provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) using the XCOM program. The coefficients derived from the measured data were up to 6% lower than those predicted by the XCOM program, while the coefficients determined from the Monte Carlo calculations were between measured and XCOM values. The results indicate that a similar process can be followed to determine the water equivalency of other solid phantoms and at other photon energies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A key feature of the proposed technique is that the workload characteristics for functional blocks are effectively captured at runtime to generate a frequency value that is continuously adjusted, thereby eliminating the delay and energy penalties incurred by transitions between power-saving modes. The workload prediction is accomplished by solving an initial value problem (IVP).

The common approach to predict walking patterns is based on the assumption that the central nervous system minimizes an intrinsic performance criterion. For instance, during walking, the energy expenditure per unit of distance traveled was shown to play a key role. The resulting optimal control problem is almost exclusively solved by the so-called dynamic optimization. Dynamic optimization relies on the parameterization of neural excitations using nodal values serving as optimization variables. The reconstructed neural excitations are then used to numerically integrate the differential equations describing the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system. This approach has been successfully applied to predict salient normal walking patterns, including muscle coordination and energy expenditure. In spite of the growing use of dynamic optimization, the extremely high computational effort arising from the several numerical integrations of the large-scale state equations required prevents it from being more widely applied, e.g., for bioassistive devices. Approaches based on inverse dynamics have the potential to reduce the high computation effort by avoiding the necessity of numerically integrating the state equations, but have been poorly explored in biomechanics. The development of an inverse dynamics-based approach to generate near-optimal human walking patterns that deals with the overdeterminacy of muscle actuation in conjunction with Hill-type muscle models widely used in biomechanics is proposed in this paper. The approach is based on the parameterization of the motion and muscle forces. The neural excitations are obtained by inverting the muscle contraction and activation dynamics. The compatibility between motion and muscle forces is guaranteed by checking the fulfillment of the equations of motion of the skeletal system at control points. The approach is implemented and human normal and pathological gaits are generated and applied to the design of transtibial prostheses. Copyright © 2007 by ASME."""

Numerical results were obtained with a commercial code Fluent 6.0. For a heat feedback rate of 1% of average heat input, the porous medium attained a temperature of 465 K. This data agreed well with experimental data obtained by infrared imaging. With an increase in heat feedback rate, the porous medium temperature also increased. Surface temperature distribution in porous media for different heat feedback rates was predicted. Results indicate that the transverse distribution was uniform within 1.5% of the mean value. Droplet diameter was smaller in spray core upstream of porous medium and increased radially due to the swirling action imparted to the atomizing air. Transverse vapor concentration results downstream of porous medium show that the distribution was uniform within 5% of the mean value, which demonstrates that porous medium uniformly distributes the fuel vapor-air mixture. The spatially homogeneous reactant mixture is important to achieve good combustion, reduce pollutant formation, and minimize instabilities in practical combustors.

Based on this information, we developed estimates of the local geothermal gradient that bracket its true value. Reasonable estimates of the initial pressure distribution in the HBL can be obtained because it follows closely the hydrostatic. Other critical information needs include the hydrate saturation, and the intrinsic permeabilities of the system formations.

These panels consist of the space-facing facet (SFF), solar panels including solar cells and earth facing facet (EFF). All these panels are key parts of the satellite's structure and are critical to mission safety. The separation panel is particularly highly loaded, since it supports the battery pack, reaction wheels, gyro module, magnetorquer rods and sun sensors. The separation panel also supports the solar panel assembly. The solar panels are also of critical importance, their integrity maintaining the required power supply to operate the satellite's electronic systems. As being different from the SFF and EFF, the solar panels are made of aluminum honeycomb panels. The solar panels are particularly sensitive, as they carry arrays of delicate ceramic solar cells together with their wiring. Throughout all loading conditions experienced during the mission, the solar panels must continue to support the solar cells without cell failures or wiring disconnections.

The US Agenda 2020 (2) and others propose to enhance the potential of existing industry assets through the innovative development of new wood products, by identifying new market functionalities for fibre, and focusing on taking advantage of forest biorefinery opportunities. Defined by Peter Axegård (3) as the """"full integration of the incoming biomass and other raw materials, including energy, for simultaneous production of fibres for paper products, chemicals and energy"""", the forest biorefinery could be integrated in retrofit to existing pulp and paper facilities. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) (4) defines a broad and complex range of possible biorefinery by-products by classifying them as building-block chemicals, added-value chemicals and bio-fuels. By successfully manufacturing added-value products from near zero-value biomass feedstocks, pulp and paper mills can potentially expect a significantly increased return on assets. But succeeding at this challenge is not obvious, which highlights the need to understand the complexity of the array of biorefinery products, and the available methods to evaluate product opportunities. In recent years other industry sectors have invested in and have begun to implement biorefinery processes, however the North American forest industry is not yet considered as having embarked on this opportunity in a substantial manner. This certainly stems from the uncertainties and risks concerning product development, process development, and business success. How can mills that have concentrated on pulp and paper commodities evolve into forest biorefinery facilities offering a complex range of products? The biorefinery concept offers a complex array of product range diversification pathways. To optimize the response to the biorefinery opportunity, pulp and paper mills need to develop specific and unique strategies for maximizing the value of their current assets. Companies must structure their decisions in order to mitigate economic and technological risks, to avoid bad investment strategies and to allocate efforts on profitable biorefinery products that are viable into the longer term. Rather than being used as a survival strategy, if implemented wisely the forest biorefinery should trigger a change in corporate culture and management, and result in significantly improved industry profitability."""

In essence, a supply chain is a set of interconnected relationships among key suppliers (vendors) and key customers spanning a hierarchy from raw materials to delivered systems. Supply chains may be shallow or deep, with the number of links determined by the number of layers in the key vendor list. The supply chain often represents symbiotic relationships, in which customers and suppliers rely on each other for success - hence giving rise to a related phrase, """"value chain"""". As one value chain partner suffers, so does the other, as witnessed by the many automotive parts plant closings in Ohio in recent years. Yet, as demand in the automotive supply chain dwindles, opportunities in new alternative energy technologies are emerging. The automotive supply chain infrastructure - consisting of manufacturing expertise, labor, perhaps even facilities-can be leveraged to build and strengthen Ohio's alternative energy supply chain. Having established a supply chain database for fuel cell technology, EMTEC is employing a similar strategy to help build Ohio supply chains in solar, wind, biomass, and clean coal technologies. This paper discusses EMTEC's general approach to the development of supply chains for emerging technologies and, in particular, the vendor-customer supply chain for the photovoltaics (PV) industry in Ohio."""

On-chip decoupling capacitors have traditionally been allocated into the white space available on the die based on an unsystematic or ad hoc approach. In this way, large decoupling capacitors are often placed at a significant distance from the current load, compromising the signal integrity of the system. This issue of power delivery cannot be alleviated by simply increasing the size of the on-chip decoupling capacitors. To be effective, the on-chip decoupling capacitors should be placed physically close to the current loads. The area occupied by the on-chip decoupling capacitor, however, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the capacitor. The minimum impedance between the on-chip decoupling capacitor and the current load is therefore fundamentally affected by the magnitude of the capacitor. A distributed on-chip decoupling capacitor network is proposed in this paper. A system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors is shown to provide an efficient solution for providing the required on-chip decoupling capacitance under existing technology constraints. In a system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors, each capacitor is sized based on the parasitic impedance of the power distribution grid. Various tradeoffs in a system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors are also discussed. Related simulation results for typical values of on-chip parasitic resistance are also presented. An analytic solution is shown to provide accurate distributed system. The worst case error is 0.003% as compared to SPICE.

Since the threshold voltage drop across an nMOS device degrades the high logic value, causing the pMOS transistor of the downstream buffer to not turn fully off, this approach suffers from static power consumption and reduced noise margins. The standard pMOS transistor pull-up in an active feedback of an inverter reduces the static power consumption, but degrades the switching time and/or active power consumption. We propose a circuit technique to build level-restoring buffers, which improves the propagation delay or active power consumption at a tiny area penalty. Our main idea is to replicate the nMOS element of the downstream buffer, where each replica is driven by a signal that originates from earlier stages of the nMOS-tree multiplexer. This way, when passing high logic values, signals from earlier stages directly drive the downstream buffer improving the delay or the slope of the transition edge. The passing of low logic values is still performed in the original way by the nMOS tree and the pMOS element of the downstream buffer.

For other supply, mostly heat, the HTR brings a solution inaccessible to conventional nuclear power plants for very high or even high temperature. As fossil fuels costs increase and efforts to avoid generation of Greenhouse gases are implemented, a market for nuclear generated process heat will develop. Following active developments in the 80's, HTR have been put on the back burner up to 5 years ago. Light water reactors are widely dominating the nuclear production field today. However, interest in the HTR technology was renewed in the past few years. Several commercial projects are actively promoted, most of them aiming at electricity production. ANTARES is today AREVA's response to the cogeneration market. It distinguishes itself from other concepts with its indirect cycle design powering a combined cycle power plant. Several reasons support this design choice, one of the most important of which is the design flexibility to adapt readily to combined heat and power applications. From the start, AREVA made the choice of such flexibility with the belief that the HTR market is not so much in competition with LWR in the sole electricity market but in the specific added value market of cogeneration and process heat. In view of the volatility of the costs of fossil fuels, AREVA's choice brings to the large industrial heat applications the fuel cost predictability of nuclear fuel with the efficiency of a high temperature heat source free of greenhouse gases emissions. The ANTARES module produces 600 MWth which can be split into the required process heat, the remaining power drives an adapted prorated electric plant. Depending on the process heat temperature and power needs, up to 80 % of the nuclear heat is converted into useful power. An important feature of the design is the standardization of the heat source, as independent as possible of the process heat application. This should expedite licensing. The essential conditions for success include: 1. Timely adapted licensing process and regulations, codes and standards for such application and design 2.

The one fundamental difference between SMR-BAWs and FBARs, is the means by which the acoustic energy is trapped. For FBAR, the air/crystal interface on both faces of the resonator ensures that the main mode of interest (the thickness extensional mode, TE1) is appropriately trapped. In the SMR-BAW, Bragg reflectors underneath the resonator, effectively trap this mode. This addition of a Bragg reflector will degrade the effective coupling coefficient as well as creating additional Q loss mechanisms. The science of improving Q must focus on the edges of the resonator for FBAR, while for SMR devices, both the edges and the vertical design of the Bragg reflector must be optimized.

Yet, its quantification remains cumbersome and as a consequence adhesion models are scarce. The effect of surface roughness, free energy, and ozone treatment on adhesion of rough low linear density polyethylene films was investigated. Adhesion was measured by a 180° peel strength test. The plastic films were roughened (surface roughness ratio, r, ranged from 1.00 to 1.15). Exposing the film to ozone treatment (0 to 300 s) modified its surface free energy, ?s (32.4 to 37.9 mJ/m2, respectively), and its polar component of the surface free energy, ?ps (3.0 to 8.3 mJ/m2, respectively). The films were coated with polyurethane capable of forming hydrogen bonds. Adhesion was found to be a function of the apparent contact angle of water, ?ap[water], surface roughness ratio, and surface free energy. The linear relationship between the apparent contact angle of water, ?ap[water], and ? ps was incorporated in building an empirical model that quantifies peel strength as function of r and ?ps. The model showed good agreement with experimental data, especially for longer ozone exposures and rougher surfaces. The empirical model provides insight into the relationships between surface roughness, surface energy, and adhesion. Quantifying these effects could facilitate reducing biofilm forming on food equipment, antisticking treatments, or easy peel packages, or reducing food residues adhering to the food packages and consequently minimize oxidation, off flavors, and waste. © 2007 Institute of Food Technologists."""

The peptides are presented on the surface of the cells in complex with major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) molecules. Identification of peptides that bind MHC II molecules is thus a key step in rational vaccine design and developing methods for accurate prediction of the peptide: MHC interactions play a central role in epitope discovery. The MHC class II binding groove is open at both ends making the correct alignment of a peptide in the binding groove a crucial part of identifying the core of an MHC class II binding motif. Here, we present a novel stabilization matrix alignment method, SMM-align, that allows for direct prediction of peptide:MHC binding affinities. The predictive performance of the method is validated on a large MHC class II benchmark data set covering 14 HLA-DR (human MHC) and three mouse H2-IA alleles. Results: The predictive performance of the SMM-align method was demonstrated to be superior to that of the Gibbs sampler, TEPITOPE, SVRMHC, and MHCpred methods. Cross validation between peptide data set obtained from different sources demonstrated that direct incorporation of peptide length potentially results in over-fitting of the binding prediction method. Focusing on amino terminal peptide flanking residues (PFR), we demonstrate a consistent gain in predictive performance by favoring binding registers with a minimum PFR length of two amino acids. Visualizing the binding motif as obtained by the SMM-align and TEPITOPE methods highlights a series of fundamental discrepancies between the two predicted motifs. For the DRB1*1302 allele for instance, the TEPITOPE method favors basic amino acids at most anchor positions, whereas the SMM-align method identifies a preference for hydrophobic or neutral amino acids at the anchors. Conclusion: The SMM-align method was shown to outperform other state of the art MHC class II prediction methods. The method predicts quantitative peptide:MHC binding affinity values, making it ideally suited for rational epitope discovery. The method has been trained and evaluated on the, to our knowledge, largest benchmark data set publicly available and covers the nine HLA-DR supertypes suggested as well as three mouse H2-IA allele.

The purpose of this project is to develop a method to encourage fuel efficiency in motorsport and enable vehicles running different types of fuels to race on a competitive basis without having to set up a complex set of rules for every application and while maintaining exciting racing for both teams and spectators. Motorsport technologies typically focus on maximum vehicle performance as their prime criteria for optimisation. In this respect they have begun to diverge from the primary technological goal of road car development, which is now focussed around improvement of efficiency and fuel economy. In this paper, a method is proposed whereby the two goals can be combined, allowing technology flow between road cars and racing cars, making participation more attractive for vehicle manufacturers and at the same time improving the environmental credentials of motor racing. The basis of the proposed method is to cap the instantaneous fuel flow energy to the engine to a maximum value. In this way the race car developers are encouraged to improve the efficiency of the powertrain in order to extract the maximum useable power from the amount of fuel allowed. A method of implementation was found in the form of an inline fuel flow meter that allows monitoring of fuel flow to the engine. Vehicles will need to be recalibrated to run to a fuel flow limit instead of an air flow limit imposed by an air restrictor used in most race series today. Fuel flow limits can be defined for various fuels based on the net heat of combustion of the fuel, so that all vehicles racing in one series have the same maximum energy flow to the engine regardless of fuels used. A system to monitor fuel flow was designed and tested in 2005 on a British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) vehicle running a mixture of ethanol and gasoline.

As a consequence, the construction of new and the management of existing infrastructure are today posing complex economical and technological problems to owners, governmental bodies and societal organizations worldwide. The economical effort of building, replacing or retrofitting of infrastructure is particularly important in industrialized countries, where the existing infrastructure stock is subjected to ageing and obsolescence. For example, the majority of the transportation infrastructure existing in the Europe and in the United States has been built from the 50's to the 70's, when the characteristics of the traffic intensity and loads were significantly different from that of today and when some of the phenomena related to material degradation were not fully discovered or understood. Moreover, the problem is not confined to transportation infrastructure, but also includes other types of infrastructure like energy production and distribution systems, water supplies and wastewater treatment plants, communication facilities, schools, hospitals, homeland defense installations, etc. The development of infrastructure management systems able to optimize the costs needed to keep existing facilities at an acceptable level of performance has been therefore the subject of extensive research activity in the past few decades, leading in some cases to standardized codes of practice but also giving rise, especially as concerning the statement of global approaches, to challenging interdisciplinary problems that the scientific community has come to face in the more recent years and that represent a very promising research field in civil engineering. Basically, to establish a global approach to the management of existing infrastructure, an optimal strategy for programming maintenance and retrofitting interventions shall be found in such a way to minimize some """"cost"""" function while keeping some """"performance"""" or """"condition"""" measure (index) within a specified acceptable bound. Maintenance interventions may be decided on the basis of time or condition, cost and cost-condition relationship to the aim of preventing excessive degradation of the performance indices and delay retrofitting activities that have the scope of carrying the performance indices back to their target values. There are many parameters that influence the decision making process, like the law of degradation and the effect of the interventions on it. Essentially these parameters are of a stochastic nature and the effect of uncertainties renders this decision making process very cumbersome. Uncertainties derive from the complex phenomena that govern material degradation, unknown factors concerning the building process, the gap between design hypotheses and real conditions, from cost evaluations and from the definition of performance measures and corresponding limit states with respect to the conditions that in the reality render the infrastructure unusable or unsafe. Many practical procedures already in use by infrastructure owners and state agencies for the definition of performance indices and strategies are based on heuristics"	" these procedures have revealed to be effective in the management of an infrastructure containing a large number of homogeneous critical structures (e.g. bridges) essentially to the aim of prioritizing interventions. However, many recently proposed approaches are based on a more scientific background and take advantage of algorithmic procedures derived from the context of mathematical optimization and from the control theory. The paper is aimed at discussing some of the relevant problems arising from the conception, design and installation of a monitoring system able to perform a permanent """"health monitoring"""" function and to provide the information needed to reduce the effect of the uncertainties in view of the application of policy selection procedures for infrastructure management. After the type of monitoring has been selected the different components of the system shall be properly designed. For designing a sensory system, the scope of monitoring i.e. the physical parameters that shall be taken under control and the phenomena that need to be traced, shall be clearly understood. The type and number of sensors, their characteristics and their locations are strictly dependent on the above considerations and will greatly affect the economy and durability of the system. The physical quantities that may be measured include mechanical (strains, displacements, etc.) chemical, thermal quantities, as well as environmental (wind or wave characteristics, etc.) or loading (weight-in-motion). To design a sensory system able to perform economically, redundancy of measurements shall be reduced to a minimum. This requires a careful study of the features of the structural response that are to be extracted from the measurements. It has to be recalled that the cost of the data carriers and data loggers depends on the number of sensors and that, in a continuous monitoring system, an excessive number of sensors dramatically increases the amount of data to be processed. Maintainability of a sensory system may represent a big issue. To date, we have no information on the expected life of many of current sensor technologies compared to the expected duration of monitoring. In view of a continuous monitoring extended over the entire operational life of the structure, the problem of updating the technology of the sensory system shall be considered. Accessibility to critical components of the system shall always be ensured. It should be pointed out that present experience demonstrates that sensors have been continuously used on real structures for more than ten years without encountering significant problems. However there is no clear evidence that the systems will continue to operate for the expected life of the structure, i.e. for the next 50 or 100 years. Reliability of sensors, data carriers and data loggers for the long periods of observation expected for as continuous monitoring is also very important to minimize the down times and the consequent loss of data. The possibility of measurement failures shall also be considered. Flexibility in the sensory system means that the possibility of reconfiguring the sensor network during the operational life of the system shall also be appropriately considered. Flexibility can be obtained through a careful study of the data carrier/data logger subsystems. For large systems the identification of sub-networks, the use of conventional or wireless platforms, of distributed data acquisition modules and web-based applications shall also be considered. In designing the data management subsystem for a continuous monitoring solution, the following issues are very important. The system shall be able to form and render easily accessible the time series of the readings of each instrument in the system. These time series shall be always referable to unique time origins, processed for eliminating errors and filling the gaps due to temporary malfunctioning of some subsystem or instrument and for filtering out the effects of the phenomena that will not be considered in the subsequent processing. Data analysis and interpretation is the subsystem that is responsible for feature extraction and damage identification. Relatively extensive experiments and practical applications have been performed by using model-based techniques associated with static and dynamic monitoring. Non-model-based techniques, especially if applied to continuous static monitoring, have been mainly the subject of research studies and it has to be stated that, for the time being, there is no clear evidence from real experiences that damage detection and identification is a reliable outcome of their application. Sensory systems are also discussed in the paper, because current and near-future technologies provide a wide range of new possibility for the monitoring of structures. Among these technologies, the capabilities of fiber optic sensors, GPS and wireless integrated platforms are shortly presented. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group."""

The ESR was supplied by Electrocycling in Germany. The tests were successfully completed from an operational standpoint without long time delays and did not show any mechanical blockage during the test in spite of the high heating value, 23 GJ/t, of the ESR. The grate was operated at close to 90 percent throughput. Clean gas concentrations of chlorinated dioxins/furans were all well below the 0.1 ng ITE /m3 regulatory limit. Raw gas HCl and HBr concentrations were in the expected range of 1000 - 2000 mg/m3 and 50 - 200 mg/m3, respectively.

Food scientists have found that by reducing the moisture content of food to between 10 and 20%, bacteria, yeast, mold and enzymes are all prevented from spoiling it. India is blessed with an abundance of sunlight, water and biomass. Vigorous efforts during the past two decades are now bearing fruit as people in all walks of life are more aware of the benefits of renewable energy, especially solar energy in villages and in urban or semi-urban centers of India. Industries that can benefit from application of solar energy to heat air are Food, Textiles, Dairies, Pharma and Chemical. This paper reviews the present scenario of Solar Air Dryer and strategies for future developments in India. Copyright © 2006 by ASME."""

This paper describes the potential of materials and particularly materials in the built environment to deliver not only greater sequestration but conversion of many wastes to resources, solving two major problems facing the globe today. All materials are ultimately derived from the bio-geo-sphere. They are everything between the take and waste and are the key to sustainability. The choice of materials for construction controls whole of life cycle impacts such as emissions, gross take, properties of wastes returned to the bio-geo-sphere, use of recycled wastes and their own recylability. Materials also strongly influence lifetime energies, user comfort and durability. The built environment encompasses the major proportion of all materials flows and is our footprint on the planet. The materials we use strongly influence linkages with the wider bio-geo sphere and must be significantly changed to improve sustainability. An example of such a paradigm technology shift would be to incorporate carbon as a component of durable building materials as well as many other wastes for their physical properties. By making carbon a resource in construction we would be mimicking nature as substantial quantities of carbon were used during previous epochs of global warming to form carbonate sediments, coal and petroleum. End users would not discern any detrimental changes, architects would have a much wider range of material composites with different properties to select materials from and the process would easily be made economic underpinning the legally imposed cost of carbon by the Kyoto treaty with real economic value. By making sustainability an economic process then economic forces will be able to be relied upon to deliver the massive sequestration and waste utilisation required to save the planet from further significant climate change.

Like many novel household cleaning products, the Fabric Media technology applies the science of active washable micro fibres as the means of capturing contaminant solid particles. The simple Fabric Media water filtration product offers several attractive attributes when compared to the more traditional media bed filtration processes such as sand filters, and barrier filters such as micro membranes. A micro fibre based filtration media enables both superior adsorption for the contaminant and wash ability. Stronger adsorption capture enables a much higher flux and greater solids loading density for the filtration task, meaning that lower cost and smaller footprint equipment is available. For Fabric Media water filters, a textile weave is selected that minimises the flow backpressure for a given particle size separation. Thus for an equivalent filtration performance this provides a much lower operating energy requirement, generally between 50 and 80% less than for a sand filter. A Fabric Media is not abrasive to itself or to the filter tank. The filtration performance remains constant and predictable. The equipment life is much longer and the asset value of the new filtration equipment should maintain throughout the project life. Fibres are extremely mechanically robust and chemically inert. Fabric Media survives repetitive exposure to a rapid mechanical washing event providing high wash efficiency with minimum equipment off-line time for the backwash. Dislodging captured contaminants by a high-speed mechanical agitation enables a minimum off-line time during backwash events. The vigorous backwash destroys adhering flocculant and eliminates the formation of mud balls, which can permanently foul sand filters. The mechanical agitation wash of the Fabric Media water filter ensures complete removal of grease and biofilm, which can adhere and block a membrane surface. In comparison to sand filters and micro filtration membranes, the Fabric Media product is applicable to a significantly wider range of solids concentrations without permanent damage. The technology is very forgiving to excursion in plant control and is therefore considered a very operator-friendly concept."""

The benefits of the flexible design are energy savings, delay of capital costs and capability of mitigating the risk of a failed building (by installing the mechanical cooling system).

One result is a probability distribution of the time when the maximum allowable indoor temperature under natural ventilation is exceeded, which may be """"never."""" Probability distributions are also obtained for energy savings and cost savings as compared to a mechanically cooled building. Together, these results allow decision-makers to evaluate the long-term performance risks and opportunities afforded by a flexible implementation strategy for natural ventilation. It is shown that the likelihood of future installation of mechanical cooling is most sensitive to design parameters. The impact of increased climate variability depends on the local climate. The probability of installing the mechanical system also depends on the comfort criteria. The results show that capital costs for cooling equipment are much greater than the present value of 10 years of cooling energy costs.

The average commercial building has smaller and more diverse energy requirements than would be expected at a typical industrial site. Consequently, even though the electrical requirements of the commercial and industrial sectors are very similar there is nine times more installed industrial CHP capacity than commercial CHP in the U.S. However, the advent of microturbines and increasing commercial viability of fuel cells promises generator sizes much more suitable for use in the commercial sector. There are many possible uses for the waste heat in a commercial building, depending upon geographic location, occupant requirements and the energy cost structures of both fuel and grid electricity. Possible waste heat technologies include absorption chillers, humidifiers, desiccant dehumidifiers, steam generators, hot water heating, space heating and thermal storage. Several of these could be combined with a generator to produce a commercial CHP for Buildings package. A well-designed and operated package should deliver energy and environmental savings as well as significant cost savings to the customer. Other potential value streams are improved indoor air quality, peak shaving to reduce demand charges, enhanced power reliability, tradable environmental credits or grid independence.

One of the main advantages of this technique, in addition to its non-destructiveness and the lack of additional processing, is the wide range of implant conditions (dose and energy) over which the technique is effective. However, it has long been recognized that there can be substantial variations in the dose sensitivity of this technique depending on the TW value.

This dose sensitivity minimum can significantly effect the ability to properly monitor implant dose variations near this minimum. In order to better characterize this sensitivity variation, a matrix of wafers was implanted with variations in both dose and energy with sufficient dose resolution to provide useful sensitivity data. The variation in dose for boron implants was from 5×1011 to l×l014 ions/cm2 and in energy from 3 to 500 keV.

State-of-the-art advances in ruggedizing superconducting platforms make them much more robust for field applications. In addition, microminiaturization and advances in refrigeration have enabled the systems engineering of portable, durable, survivable, low power requirement devices. This presentation describes a prototype system employing YBCO (yttrium barium copper oxide) superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDS) with specific biolayer detection dye coatings. These devices may be deployed as specific stand-off detectors, or potentially reconfigured as point sensors. A library of pattern recognition algorithms provides the reference template for the system. The human-system interface will provide a 'yes/no' agent confirmation for the environment being queried, and associated confidence value. This prototype detection system has great potential for deployment in support of hostage rescue/rapid response teams, DMAT, and urban search and rescue. The preparation and characterization of a new generation of optical sensors fabricated from high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) thin films is reported herein. These new hybrid devices are fashioned using HTSC thin films which are coated with organic dye overlayers. These systems are shown to respond selectively to those wavelengths which are absorbed strongly by the molecular dye. Methods for fabricating the superconductor element and depositing the dye layer are discussed. Moreover, resistivity versus temperature measurements before and after dye deposition are utilized to characterize these hybrid structures. The unique optical response properties of these hybrid sensors are also detailed. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering."""

ATP depletion is a central process in pathogenesis, in particular ischaemia, hypoxia and hypoglycaemia. ATP depletion in cells can be indirectly measured from the increased concentrations of extracellular hypoxanthine, a central intermediate in the metabolism of ATP. Cell damage secondary to ATP depletion can also be measured from extracellular hypoxanthine. The relevant biochemistry and physiology is briefly reviewed. Since market size is needed for investment decisions that would allow technology transfer, the numbers of hypoxanthine analyses that are clinically justified from the extensive published evidence are calculated per million population from UK, Norwegian and other evidence. The concentration of oxygen in blood is measured to estimate whether mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is adequate. Measurements of bicarbonate are used to estimate anaerobic glycolysis. Since the indirect estimation of ATP depletion is a major objective of blood gas and acid-base analyses, the number of such analyses per million population provides a good estimate of potential market size for a more direct method of estimating ATP depletion.

CAGT is a consortium of domestic and international electric companies. gas companies and research organizations. ICAD gas turbine technology was selected by CAGT member companies and potential suppliers in a competitive $5 million screening study of various advanced gas turbine options in the 1992-94 time frame. Efforts to commercialize ICAD began in 1994-95. The most attractive ICAO gas turbine options were based on high thrust engines produced by General Electric. Pratt & Whitney and Rolls Royce aircraft divisions. Simple cycle ICAD represents a new intermediate load gas turbine product class with costs and performance unlike any other product available today. Simple cycle efficiencies will approach those of many operating combined cycles, but with the low capital costs and rapid start times of a peaking gas turbine. ICAD simple cycle units would be in the 100-130 MW size range with efficiencies in the range of 45-48% + LHV and combined cycle efficiencies potentially as high as 60% + Lily. All efficiencies are presented in the paper in lower heating value (LAW). ICAD gas turbines will address a wide range of simple cycle, cogeneration. innovative repowering, combined cycle, distributed generation and renewable energy applications. CAGT members have • several projects underway with the goal of the first ICAD unit to begin operation before the year 2000. Industry restructuring has reduced near-term demand for new generation in the United States with a corresponding drop in gas turbine prices. Given the large development cost for any new gas turbine product, potential ICAD suppliers have indicated the need for a launch order to proceed with development. CAGT is pursuing number of project development and strategic alliance strategies globally to organize a launch order in the range of 10-15 projects. Efforts are also underway to examine options for demonstrating ICAD on a smaller scale (Small ICAD or SICAD) which would address the emerging market for distributed generation.

Different types of padding are used in the computer simulations. Lumped models are developed to perform the simulations. Through the responses of the simulations one can determine what kind of padding is desired. This paper provides the first phase of using a computer-aided tool. Though much attention has been paid to either the investigation of padding or human thorax modelling, how the physical properties of padding affect thoracic protection is not well known. The combination of padding and the thorax needs a lot of effort to unveil their relationship. This paper attempts to provide the guideline of what a good padding material should be. The determination of an optimal padding is one of the goals in this study. Hopefully, the results of this paper can make a contribution to the vehicle safety design, especially the car door. A number of figures will be included in this paper to illustrate the responses of simulations. Numerical values of parameters of padding are also shown in this paper in the form of tables. In the lateral impact, the door structure and padding are the primary protection to the thorax. The former is not included in the scope of this study. The main emphasis of this paper is on the characteristics of padding. Because the padding acts as a bumper between the impactor and the thorax, the impact energy absorbed by the padding also indicates the performance of padding. As a result, the selection of a padding is made in order to reduce the remaining impact energy transmitting to the passenger.

Using intertemporal comparative statics, we investigate how economic conditions affect that relationship. In a two-period model, the net present value of the firm's cash inflows is maximized subject to constraints. The resulting investment equation for the firm is summed over all firms to produce an aggregate investment equation. By assuming that aggregate shocks do not affect every firm simultaneously, we could investigate the effects of varying economic conditions on the relationship under study. We find that energy price increases will retard aggregate real investment. Also, this restraining impact will be greatest during boom periods and least during recessions. Further, the impact of an energy price increase on aggregate investment diminishes as the level of energy prices increases. We show that simple OLS techniques are not appropriate for empirical estimation of the relationship between aggregate investment and energy price"	" they could produce inconsistent results depending on the time period studied because of the business cycle effects.

The Julich study group based their investigation on a complex model linking the technique of value tree analysis with traditional methods of technology assessment and the incorporation of participatory involvement by citizens. First, by interviewing representatives of stakeholder groups the concerns and criteria relevant to the energy debate were collected and sorted, secondly, the impacts of each dimension were measured or estimated (via expert ratings or judgements) and thirdly, the weights and evaluations for each criterion and option were assigned by so called planning cells. Planning cells consist of groups of citizens who are selected by random process and are given paid leave from their workday obligations for a limited period of time to work out solutions for social problems. A total of 24 planning cells were organized throughout Germany to evaluate the four energy scenarios and to formulate recommendations for the policy maker. One outstanding result was that most citizens favored the more moderate scenarios, but were almost equally devided in their preference distribution with respect to the pronuclear and non-nuclear option.

(4) The unwillingness of the stake-holder groups to move towards a compromise. A discussion is also presented of steps to be taken toward a socially acceptable energy policy. An investigation was also conducted of social preferences and the results are assessed using a value-tree analysis.

Because of the way the electron beams are used in these two procedures, they are rarely incident normally on the surface of the tissue to be treated, but are inclined at some angle. Previous work has shown that when low-energy electron beams are used in this way, the per cent depth-dose curves, when measured along the oblique axis (the central axis of the beam) show a decrease compared with normal incidence. To quantify this effect in detail the per cent depth dose distributions of electron beams in the energy range 4-29 MeV have been studied as a function of their angle of incidence with respect to the normal ( phi ) between 0 and 60 degrees . The curves for different phi are compared by plotting the per cent depth dose along the central axis in each case: at low energies, this decreases as phi increases, while at the highest energies, the change is very small. The surface dose also changes, increasing with phi at low energies and decreasing at high energies."""

Our findings clearly indicate that the extension of penumbra near the geometrical edge of a split beam is considerably less than that of an open beam of the same field size.
