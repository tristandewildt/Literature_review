Under the current UK regulatory framework for electricity distribution networks asset upgrades are planned with the objectives of minimising both capital costs and thus customer fees and social costs such as those associated with carbon emissions and customer interruptions This approach naturally results in economic trade offs as network solutions meant to reduce social costs typically increase sometimes significantly capital costs and vice versa This can become an issue in a smart grid context where new operational solutions such as Demand Response DR may emerge More specifically even though there is a general belief that smart solutions will only provide benefits due to their potential to displace investments in costly assets e g lines and substations they may also introduce trade offs associated with increased operational expenditure power losses and emissions compared with networks with upgraded assets On the other hand the flexibility inherent in smart solutions could be used to balance the different types of costs leading to attractive cost trade offs if properly modelled quantified and regulated However given the fundamental non asset nature of DR properly quantifying the resulting trade offs so as to perform a like for like comparison with traditional planning strategies is a grand challenge In this light this article proposes a methodology to explicitly model and quantify capital and social cost trade offs in distribution network planning which can be incorporated into the existing regulatory framework The results based on real UK distribution networks show that our proposed methodology can be used to explicitly model and regulate cost trade offs By doing so it is possible to encourage more efficient levels of capital expenditure and social benefits by deploying the right mix of traditional asset based and smart DR based solutions 2016 Elsevier B V

While the newly envisioned smart er grid SG will result in a more efficient and reliable power grid its collection and use of fine grained meter data has widely raised concerns on consumer privacy While a number of approaches are available for preserving consumer privacy these approaches are mostly not very practical to be used due to two reasons 1 Since the data is hidden this reduces the ability of the utility company to use the data for distribution state estimation 2 The approaches were not tested under realistic wireless infrastructures that are currently in use In this paper we propose to implement a meter data obfuscation approach to preserve consumer privacy that has the ability to perform distribution state estimation We then assess its performance on a large scale advanced metering infrastructure AMI network built upon the new IEEE 802 11s wireless mesh standard For the data obfuscation approach we propose two secure obfuscation value distribution mechanisms on this 802 11s based wireless mesh network WMN Using obfuscation values provided via this approach the meter readings are obfuscated to protect consumer privacy from eavesdroppers and the utility companies while preserving the utility companies ability to use the data for state estimation We assessed the impact of this approach on data goodput delay and packet delivery ratio PDR under a variety of conditions Simulation results have shown that the proposed approach can provide very similar performance to that of nonprivacy approach with negligible overheads on the meters and network 2014 IEEE
Day ahead scheduling of generation units and storage devices is essential for the economic and efficient operation of a power system Conventionally a control center calculates the dispatch schedule by gathering information from all of the devices However this centralized control structure makes the system vulnerable to single point of failure and communication failures and raises privacy concerns In this paper a fully distributed algorithm is proposed to find the optimal dispatch schedule for a smart grid with renewable and energy storage integration The algorithm considers modified dc power flow constraints branch energy losses and energy storage charging and discharging efficiencies In this algorithm each bus of the system is modeled as an agent By solely exchanging information with its neighbors the optimal dispatch schedule of the conventional generators and energy storage can be achieved in an iterative manner The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through several representative case studies 2010 2012 IEEE

Grid connected energy storage systems are regarded as promising solutions for providing ancillary services to electricity networks and to play an important role in the development of smart grids Thus far the more mature battery technologies have been installed in pilot projects and studies have indicated their main advantages and shortcomings The main concerns for wide adoption are the overall cost the limited number of charging cycles or lifetime the depth of discharge the low energy density and the sustainability of materials used Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries VRFB are a promising option to mitigate many of these shortcomings and demonstration projects using this technology are being implemented both in Europe and in the USA This study presents a model using MATLAB Simulink to demonstrate how a VRFB based storage device can provide multi ancillary services focusing on frequency regulation and peak shaving functions The study presents a storage system at a medium voltage substation and considers a small grid load profile originating from a residential neighbourhood and fast charging stations demand The model also includes an inverter controller that provides a net power output from the battery system in order to offer both services simultaneously Simulation results show that the VRFB storage device can regulate frequency effectively due to its fast response time while still performing peak shaving services VRFB potential in grid connected systems is discussed to increase awareness of decision makers while identifying the main challenges for wider implementation of storage systems particularly related to market structure and standardisation requirements 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved
In this paper the problem of the optimal rating of transformers in smart grids is properly discussed with respect to the specific load characteristics The design is based on the accurate prediction of the lifetime degradation of mineral oil immersed transformers subject to highly intermittent loads In fact by investigating the nature of the loads in the smart grid scenario it clearly appears that the intermittent nature of the power demand increases drastically In this context specific tools for the characterization of the lifetime duration are required since severe reduction of the transformer s life can be observed due to overloads even in the case of short duration overloads The classical approaches based on using the equivalent thermal current to predict the transformer s lifetime might result in incorrect estimates thus requiring advanced models that can deal with the time variability of the load In this paper the randomness of the load powers is addressed in terms of stochastic processes In particular the Wiener process is demonstrated to provide robust modeling of load variability By starting from this assumption it was demonstrated analytically that the hot spot temperature which is a major contributor to the degradation of the transformer s lifetime also is a stochastic process Then in spite of the nonlinearity of the thermal model the hot spot temperature can be represented as a Wiener process the robustness of which has been verified adequately By taking into account the nonlinear relationship between the hot spot temperature and the lifetime the authors verified that the transformer s lifetime is modeled as a lognormal stochastic process Hence a novel closed form relationship was derived between the transformer s lifetime and the distributional properties of the stochastic load The usefulness of the closed form expression is discussed for sake of design even if a few of the considerations also are performed with respect to operating conditions The aim of the numerical application was to demonstrate the feasibility and the easy applicability of the analytical methodology 2016 Elsevier Ltd

The IEC 61850 protocol suite is emerging as a de facto standard solution for the interoperability problem in automation networks Intelligent Electronic Devices IEDs support this protocol and their recent deployment in substation automation systems SAS raises two questions The first issue has to do with the traffic performance in an SAS and its scalability for fault management It is vital to understand beforehand whether SAS traffic withstands extreme events such as blackout situations as is often claimed by their manufacturers As our experience with these devices remains small we look to simulating their behavior under varying SAS conditions A second concern relates to the security of automation networks There is a need to evaluate the reliability of SAS critical elements Threats as diverse as terrorist and cyber attacks are feared 1 Many countries are putting in place new regulations to combat such harmful actions The IEC 61850 standard does not guaranty security as this has been left as part of the scope of a different standard namely the IEC 62531 6 4 The latter digitally signs the Generic Object Oriented Substation Event GOOSE messages carrying sampled measured values SMV Nonetheless many devices on the market do not yet support IEC 62531 Additional security mechanisms include the use of Intrusion Detection Systems IDS These monitor and analyze network traffic in an attempt to detect anomalous and unwanted traffic Some of these operate by capturing automation traffic and comparing it to known traffic profiles A threshold may for example be established to report unusual traffic patterns and to single them out as possible attack scenarios These may then be more thoroughly investigated using specialized tools This work provides a network level classification of GOOSE messages according to faults of an electricity energy system More specifically we will be looking at typical IEC 61850 response traffic that is generated as a result of a failure within an automation network The measurements illustrate substation network traffic patterns for a problem such as a TriPhase or Phase To ground fault The sampled data traffic is used for the modeling of traffic representing each of the power system faults These models can then be used next to feed other specially devised simulators used for the analysis of the performance of an SAS Furthermore the established models may potentially play a considerable role in the identification of out of profile traffic that is likely to represent security threats Finally we expect the obtained models to help with the early diagnosis of this type of failures by simply observing their traffic signature First a brief introduction of the problem of traffic measurement is given Section 2 introduces the reader to the terminology and describes the SAS scenario under evaluation The third part of this document illustrates the measured results A simple model used to understand SAS traffic patterns is described Finally comments and pointers to future work are realized 2015 IEEE
Electric vehicles EVs can be coordinated by an aggregator to participate in the electricity day Ahead market DAM and provide frequency regulation service In the DAM a short Term forward contract is made between the aggregator and an independent system operator ISO The contract specifies the contract size which is the amount of regulation capacity provided by the aggregator for each hour of the next day However since the capacity of the aggregator is provided by many EVs instead of a single source the challenge is how to efficiently aggregate the small and uncertain individual capacity and determine the optimal size of the forward contract We consider two cases for the contract between the aggregator and the ISO In the first case the aggregator needs to ensure that the capacity provided by the EVs on the next day will meet the amount specified in the contract In contrast in the second case the ISO allows an update of the contract size A stochastic program is formulated to determine the contract size for both cases Our problem formulation incorporates risk management using the conditional value at risk CVaR Chance constraints are embedded when the contract size is fixed We tackle the chance constraints using the Markov inequality and propose an efficient algorithm The EV charging data collected in the province of British Columbia Canada is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the revenue of the aggregator compared to an existing algorithm from the literature 2015 IEEE

Accurate state estimation is of paramount importance to maintain normal operations of smart power grids However recent research shows that carefully produced attacks with the knowledge of the grid topology i e Jacobian matrix can bypass the bad data detection BDD system The BDD is used to ensure the integrity of state estimation to filter faulty measurements introduced by device malfunctions or malicious attacks However to construct the false data injection attack vectors a common assumption in most prior works on false data injection attacks is that the attacker has complete knowledge about the power grid topology and transmission line admittances By contrast this paper studies the general problem of blind false data injection attacks using the principal component analysis approximation method without the knowledge of Jacobian matrix and the assumption regarding the distribution of state variables The proposed attack is proven to be approximately stealthy 1 The performance of the proposed attack is analyzed Simulations confirm the performance of the proposed method 2010 2012 IEEE
In the transition to the smart grid the electricity networks are becoming more data intensive with more data producing devices deployed increasing both the opportunities and challenges in how the collected data are used For example in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure AMI the devices and their corresponding data give more information about the operational parameters of the environment but also details about the habits of the people living in the houses monitored by smart meters Different anonymization techniques have been proposed to minimize privacy concerns among them the use of pseudonyms In this work we return to the question of the effectiveness of pseudonyms by investigating how a previously reported methodology for depseudonymization performs given a more realistic and larger dataset than was previously used We also propose and compare the results with our own simpler de pseudonymization methodology Our results indicate not surprisingly that large realistic datasets are very important to properly understand how an experimental method performs Results based on small datasets run the risk of not being generalizable In particular we show that the number of re identified households by breaking pseudonyms is dependent on the size of the dataset and the period where the pseudonyms are constant and not changed In the setting of the smart grid results will even vary based on the season when the dataset was captured Knowing that relative simple changes in the data collection procedure may significantly increase the resistance to deanonymization attacks will help future AMI deploymen
The ANSI C12 22 is a standard that specifies interfaces to data communication networks in the smart grid In this paper we discuss several vulnerabilities by design that we discovered in the ANSI C12 22 protocol specification during an analysis of the overall protocol architecture The consequences of an exploitation of those vulnerabilities consist of denial of service conditions and disruptions to ANSI C12 22 nodes and relays We developed attack code to experiment with exploitations of most of the vulnerabilities that we discuss in this paper Our research testbed consisted of meters that we emulated via the Trilliant TstBench software The emulated meters were running on virtual Windows machines on a virtual network In the paper we provide details of the vulnerabilities by design that we identified and thus propose a series of revisions of the ANSI C12 22 protocol specification with the objective of mitigating those vulnerabilities Copyright 2015 ACM
Due to the significant environmental impact of power production from fossil fuels and nuclear fission future energy systems will increasingly rely on distributed and renewable energy sources RES The electrical feed in from photovoltaic PV systems and wind energy converters WEC varies greatly both over short and long time periods from minutes to seasons and not only by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching In addition with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids the top down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom up power supply This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids In order to address these challenges the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced The inherent flexibilities i e the set of feasible power schedules of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand supply matching as well as stable grid operation Controllable power units are e g combined heat and power plants power storage systems such as batteries and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure In this context decentralized systems autonomous agents and the concept of self organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units In this contribution we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging discharging of electrical vehicles EVs can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary We introduce a method for self organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids Subsequently we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants DVPP offering products at a power market For an efficient organization of DVPPs the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine learning approach In summary this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets 2014 Elsevier In
Industrial applications have been going through significant changes in recent times In particular the trend toward globalization has changed the game significantly Global business means global competition which requires shorter product life cycles In consumer oriented businesses especially this leads to a trend toward highly customized and individualized products This imposes a number of profound and far reaching demands on modern industrial manufacturing systems such as adaptability agility responsiveness robustness flexibility reconfigurability dynamic optimization openness to new innovations and in some environments continuously varying collaborations Such goals can only be achieved if massively software controlled integrated industrial manufacturing tools machines and environments become the default In many cases typical standalone compartmentalized operations need to move toward decentralized distributed and networked manufacturing system architectures with intensive communication and collaboration especially over long distances For such complex systems in order to work efficiently a high level of understanding is necessary which translates into a reasonable understanding of domain specific semantics Multi agent based application systems seem to be a promising and natural realization choice Multi agent systems MASs provide among other things decentralized architecture and decision making modularity robustness flexibility and adaptability to changes This chapter provides a concise introduction into agent technology for industrial applications that rely on decentralized decision making and control It concentrates on industrial applications its evolvement the consequences of this evolvement on modern industrial application systems and the specific aspects and requirements on multi agent based industrial application systems It especially also discusses the holonic paradigm and challenges and research areas for industrial MASs 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved
Through smart metering in the smart grid end user domain load profiles are measured per household Personal data can be inferred from these load profiles by using nonintrusive appliance load monitoring methods which has led to privacy concerns Privacy is expected to increase with longer intervals between measurements of load curves This paper studies the impact of data granularity on edge detection methods which are the common first step in nonintrusive load monitoring algorithms It is shown that when the time interval exceeds half the on time of an appliance the appliance use detection rate declines Through a one versus rest classification modeling the ability to detect an appliance s use is evaluated through F scores Representing these F scores visually through a heatmap yields an easily understandable way of presenting potential privacy implications in smart metering to the end user or other decision makers 2010 2012 IEEE
High penetration levels from renewable energy sources in large scale power systems demand a high degree of flexibility in the transmission and distribution system This paper presents a method for utilization of flexible demand in the low voltage distribution system using the thermal mass of a building to defer power consumption from electric space heating The power consumption for heating is controlled by an operational virtual power plant which is sending a set point for requested power consumption to the building management system An optimization problem is formulated such that the discrete dispatch of power from ten electric space heaters is following the power set point given constraints on the indoor comfort that is defined by the users of the building The controlling method has been implemented in an intelligent office building and used for demonstration of flexible demand in the low voltage network 2010 2012 IEEE
The increasing demand for electric vehicles and large scale smart grids has aroused great interest in developing high energy density storage devices Lithium sulfur Li S battery has attracted much attention owing to its high theoretical energy density and abundance but many challenges such as rapid capacity fade and low sulfur loading and utilization have impeded its practical use Here we present a free standing TiO2 nanowire graphene hybrid membrane for Li dissolved polysulfide batteries with high capacity and long cycling life Graphene membrane with high electrical conductivity is used as a current collector to effectively reduce the internal resistance in the sulfur cathode and physically immobilize the dissolved lithium polysulfides The TiO2 nanowires introduced into the graphene membrane offer a hierarchical composite structure in which the TiO2 nanowires not only have strong chemical binding with the lithium polysulfides but also show a strong catalytic effect for polysulfide reduction and oxidation promoting a fast redox reaction kinetics with high capacity and low voltage polarization This hybrid electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 1327mAhg 1 at 0 2C rate a Coulombic efficiency approaching 100 high rate performance of 850mAhg 1 at 2C rate and long cyclic stability with a capacity of 1053mAhg 1 at 0 2C rate over 200 cycles demonstrating great prospect for application in high energy Li S batteries 2014 Elsevier Ltd
Electric bills consist of a cost related to the consumed energy and a cost related to the maximum demanded power This latter part usually accounts for approximately 25 40 of the bill Demanded power by big consumers is measured in real time and electric companies highly penalise them if the maximum demanded power along the billing period exceeds the contracted power by the consumer In this paper we propose a new method that given the demanded power of close consumers for a time window power profile power costs are reduced by re allocating the demanded power among consumers in order to keep all of them below or equal to their contracted power We also propose and analyse some strategies to set a preference when not all power profiles can be kept below the contracted power We tested this method using real based simulated power profiles of eight different business buildings located in Girona and the power cost reduction achieved reached approximately 20 2014 Elsevier B V All rights reserved
Rapid growth of load utilizations in conventional electric networks leads to power demand which is maintained using the non conventional resources The objective of this paper is to schedule and dispatch the power using the smart grid technology automation for distributed systems for the usage of conventional energies as a secondary source and to develop a model using MATLAB Simulink The simulation consists of feedback closed loop control to perform the demand management during normal operating conditions islanding the micro grid during the fault conditions scheduling the load during emergency conditions and to resynchronize the system when the fault is cleared A new structure of power system can be developed with improved reliability of delivering the power and increased efficiency to the consumers 2014 IEEE
Energy storage is often seen as necessary for the electric utility systems with large amounts of solar or wind power generation to compensate for the inability to schedule these facilities to match power demand This study looks at the potential to use building thermal energy storage as a load shifting technology rather than traditional electric energy storage Analyses are conducted using hourly electric load temperature wind speed and solar radiation data for a 5 state central U S region in conjunction with simple computer simulations and economic models to evaluate the economic benefit of distributed building thermal energy storage TES The value of the TES is investigated as wind and solar power generation penetration increases In addition building side and smart grid enabled utility side storage management strategies are explored and compared For a relative point of comparison batteries are simulated and compared to TES It is found that cooling TES value remains approximately constant as wind penetration increases but generally decreases with increasing solar penetration It is also clearly shown that the storage management strategy is vitally important to the economic value of TES utility side operating methods perform with at least 75 greater value as compared to building side management strategies In addition TES compares fairly well against batteries obtaining nearly 90 of the battery value in the base case this result is significant considering TES can only impact building thermal loads whereas batteries can impact any electrical load Surprisingly the value of energy storage does not increase substantially with increased wind and solar penetration and in some cases it decreases This result is true for both TES and batteries and suggests that the tie between load shifting energy storage and renewable electric power generation may not be nearly as strong as typically thought 2014

The communication network supporting Smart Grid applications must minimize the time that messages cannot be delivered and thus find alternative paths rapidly At the same time the control overhead in normal operation should be limited and not interfere with the data traffic Hence the routing protocol for such networks has to trade off these two conflicting goals One of the candidate routing protocols for Smart Grid networks is the IETF IPv6 routing protocol RPL which was designed for low power and lossy networks It strives to consume little bandwidth and energy with its traffic overhead and to be under reactive to network changes This design choice was made because in many of the technologies envisioned for such networks the bandwidth is scarce and the link quality may vary Fluctuations should not trigger unnecessary instabilities thus the system was designed to have inertia before deciding to modify communication paths However this robustness is in direct conflict with the agility that is required for fast recovery in case of communication failures In this article we investigate the behavior of the local repair failover mechanism then we propose and evaluate simple options to minimize the recovery time 2014 IEEE

With the steady growth of the photovoltaic market over the last decade the feed in of photovoltaic generators may strain the electricity grid especially in rural areas Storage devices are expected to smooth over the non simultaneous production of volatile renewable energies and their consumption In this paper we investigate to what extent domestic photovoltaic battery systems can compensate the capping of the feed in power by buffering the peak energy The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Freiburg Germany has developed a novel forecast based control scheme for photovoltaic battery systems It estimates the photovoltaic excess energy and derives a charging schedule for the battery to store the energy from the photovoltaic peak production The maximal self consumption of the locally produced renewable energy is thereby not affected We show that the maximal photovoltaic feed in power can be reduced from 70 to 60 of the nominal photovoltaic power without losses 2014 IEEE

Smart meters are a crucial part of the smart grid yet they arise several privacy concerns The fine grained consumption readings can expose information about the household such as types of devices inside the house In this paper we introduce two methods which enable a household to hide private issues The first method which is called One Level Consumption OLC tries to exploit demand response components such as battery elastic load and distributed generators to maintain a constant consumption throughout the whole day The second method which is called Maximum Difference MD obfuscates the smart meter readings before sending them to the utility company Nevertheless the transmitted values are valid for billing Taking Electric Vehicle EV charging signal as an example we have shown that it is possible to hide most charging signals 2015 IEEE
Failures in power grids have proven to be catastrophic Continuous system monitoring is essential for security and reliable operation of power grids State space models are used to estimate the states of the system from available measurements A malicious user can introduce an error in measurements or bad data can be introduced at different points in the grid resulting in unpredictable behavior of the control algorithms in SCADA systems which use the state information to make decisions Bad data detection is part of the state estimation process but if the attacker has complete knowledge of the system and access to large enough number of measurements these attacks can be made undetectable Various techniques to introduce such undetectable attacks have been discussed in literature with focus on DC models A data history based heuristic algorithm was proposed recently that can detect such attack However this technique fails when data attack model is a slow ramp We propose a novel technique based on rate of change of largest singular value of the data matrix that can detect even slow attacks on the system with focus on AC models 2014 IEEE

As a consequence of the developments in electric transportation and the evolution toward smart grids large scale deployment of smart charging strategies for electric vehicles EVs becomes feasible This leads to opportunities for different market parties to use the flexibility of EVs for various objectives that may be conflicting and result in a nonoptimal shifting of peak demands for the distribution grids In this paper we assess the financial impact of various EV charging strategies on distribution grids We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads from a network operators perspective with a strategy to minimize charging costs from the perspective of a commercial party In a scenario with a high wind penetration in the system the electricity prices are for a significant part determined by the instantaneous wind production Therefore we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and consequently on the resulting EV load and network impacts We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value NPV of the investments costs and energy losses We found that in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25 higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration The results strongly suggest that the situation where EVs are controlled with a strategy to minimize charging costs that does not take the distribution grids into account may not lead to an optimal situation when the entire electricity delivery system is regarded 2010 2012 IEEE

In the smart grids area attractive issues are created for the hackers such that they tend to interface the control of smart grids deliberately or unintentionally so that the normal operations of these systems are endangered According to the insight of the smart grids systems it is anticipated that in near future all the distribution systems would be operated smartly In this regard the state estimation and control algorithms should be improved to be able to detect and omit fake data of measurements appropriately Some methods for state estimation such as Kalman filter as a proper criterion can omit the noisy data from the measurements Similarly the chi square method is capable of detecting bad data but cannot detect and remove unreal and fake data The purpose of this work is to propose a suitable method for state estimation in the smart grids considering the possibility of having fake data measurement It will be shown that the use of evolutionary algorithms such as bat algorithm with a hybrid approach based on the weighted least square technique makes it possible to detect and omit fake data The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015
The power grid is a critical infrastructure that must be protected against potential threats While modern technologies at the center of the ongoing smart grid evolution increase its operational efficiency they also make it more susceptible to malicious attacks such as false data injection to electronic monitoring systems This paper presents a game theoretic approach to smart grid security by combining quantitative risk management techniques with decision making on protective measures The consequences of data injection attacks are quantified using a risk assessment process where the well known conditional value at risk CVaR measure provides an estimate of the defender s loss due to load shed in simulated scenarios The calculated risks are then incorporated into a stochastic security game model as input parameters The decisions on defensive measures are obtained by solving the game using dynamic programming techniques which take into account resource constraints Thus the formulated security game provides an analytical framework for choosing the best response strategies against attackers and minimizing potential risks The theoretical results obtained are demonstrated through numerical examples Simulation results show that different risk measures lead to different defense strategies but the CVaR measure prioritizes high loss tail events 2014 IEEE

The paper revisits the computation of residual covariance matrix diagonal entries which are used for calculating the normalized residuals that are in turn used for bad data identification It is shown that these entries may be inadvertently computed incorrectly if one uses the commonly accepted implementation of the sparse inverse method due to the numerical cancellations that occur in the formation of the so called gain matrix This situation occurs when the coupled measurement model is used Indeed the coupled model is required if there are current measurements that do not lend themselves to decoupling Numerical example will be given for a test power system to show the impact of these cancellations on bad data analysis that uses post processing of residuals and the largest normalized residual test The errors may lead to sequential removal of good data eventually leading to a biased estimation They may also lead to unacceptable covariance values e g less than zero which will then destroy the validity of bad data analysis While it appears like a minor oversight in the application of efficient sparse inverse implementation due to its adverse impact on state estimation and therefore overall power system operation it will have to be corrected The paper will first illustrate the issue and then a simple modification in the implementation of the sparse inverse method will be shown in order to avoid this error 2014 IEEE

Distributed power generation and distribution network with the dynamic pricing scheme are the major trend of the future smart grid A smart grid is a network which contains multiple non cooperative utility companies that offer time of use dependent energy prices to energy consumers and aim to maximize their own profits Decentralized power network allows each energy consumer to have multiple choices among different utility companies In this paper an optimization framework is introduced to determine the energy price for utility companies in an oligopolistic energy market At the beginning of each billing period a day each utility company will announce the time of use dependent pricing policy during the billing period and each energy consumer will subsequently choose a utility company for energy supply to minimize the expected energy cost The energy pricing competition among utility companies forms an n person game because the pricing strategy of each utility company will affect the profits of others To be realistic the prediction error of a user s energy consumption is properly accounted for in this paper and is assumed to satisfy certain probability distribution at each time slot We start from the most commonly used normal distribution and extend our optimization framework to a more general case A Nash equilibrium based pricing policy is presented for the utility companies and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium is proved Experimental results show the effectiveness of our game theoretic price determination framework 2014 IEEE

When a power grid is overloaded load shedding is a conventional way to combat the imbalance between supply and demand that may jeopardize the grid s safety However disconnected customers may be excessively inconvenienced or even endangered With the emergence of demand response based on cyber enabled smart meters and appliances customers may participate in solving the imbalance by curtailing their demands collaboratively such that no single customers will have to bear a disproportionate burden of reduced usage However compliance or commitment to curtailment requests by untrusted users is uncertain which causes an important safety concern This paper proposes a two phase load management scheme that i gives customers a chance to curtail their demands and correct a grid s undersupply when there are no immediate safety concerns but ii falls back to conventional load shedding to ensure safety once the grid enters a vulnerable state Extensive simulations based on a 37 bus electrical grid and traces of real electrical load demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme In particular if customers are as expected sufficiently committed to the load curtailment overloads can be resolved in real time by collaborative and graceful usage degradation among them thereby avoiding unpleasant blackouts in existing practice 2014 IEEE

Islanding refers to the condition in which one or more distributed generators continue to power a section of the network even though grid power from the electric utility is no longer present Unwanted islanding can be dangerous to utility workers who may not realize that a circuit is still powered Furthermore because the present electrical systems are not designed to work under these condition the unwanted isle is uncontrolled with reference to protection system in case of fault rated values of voltage and frequency Finally reclosing the circuit onto an active island may cause problems with the utility s equipment For that reason a smart grid must prevent islanding or detect it and immediately clear the situation In this work the unwanted island generation and maintaining are analyzed for a 4 wires LV grid composed by a mix of generators and loads Both single phase and three phase generators are considered in order to have an unbalanced grid with realistic topology Analysis is performed using the Real Time Digital Simulator RTDS installed in the Enel Test Center of Milan The purpose of this work is to evaluate the real risk of islanding analyzing different scenarios and taking into account transitory phenomena and capability limits of generato

The rising penetration of intermittent power sources such as solar photovoltaic systems is a concern for electric utility operators and techniques to mitigate the effect of power variability have been proposed One method is to use electric vehicle EV batteries connected through fast bidirectional chargers as short time scale storage devices for intermittent power sources This allows the high frequency components of intermittent power to be diverted to the EV battery while the remaining slowly changing power is fed to the AC distribution system However studies of lithium ion Li ion EV batteries have shown that frequent and rapid charging and discharging reduces battery lifetime Using an empirically validated Li ion battery degradation model this paper demonstrates that the effect of intermittency mitigation IM on battery lifetime is small This conclusion is validated with publicly available irradiance data and daily EV usage data from a large scale study 2013 IEEE

Smart meters are key elements for the operation of smart grids By providing near realtime information on the energy consumption of individual users smart meters increase the efficiency in generation distribution and storage of energy in a smart grid The ability of the utility provider to track users energy consumption inevitably leads to important threats to privacy In this paper privacy in a smart metering system is studied from an information theoretic perspective in the presence of energy harvesting and storage units It is shown that energy harvesting provides increased privacy by diversifying the energy source while a storage device can be used to increase both the energy efficiency and the privacy of the user For given input load and energy harvesting rates it is shown that there exists a trade off between the information leakage rate which is used to measure the privacy of the user and the wasted energy rate which is a measure of the energy efficiency The impact of the energy harvesting rate and the size of the storage device on this trade off is also studied 1983 2012 IEEE
Distributed generation DG uses many small on site energy harvesting deployments at individual buildings to generate electricity DG has the potential to make generation more efficient by reducing transmission and distribution losses carbon emissions and demand peaks However since renewables are intermittent and uncontrollable buildings must still rely in part on the electric grid for power While DG deployments today use net metering to offset costs and balance local supply and demand scaling net metering for intermittent renewables to a large fraction of buildings is challenging In this paper we explore an alternative approach that combines market based electricity pricing models with on site renewables and modest energy storage in the form of batteries to incentivize DG We propose a system architecture and optimization algorithm called GreenCharge to efficiently manage the renewable energy and storage to reduce a building s electric bill To determine when to charge and discharge the battery each day the algorithm leverages prediction models for forecasting both future energy demand and future energy harvesting We evaluate GreenCharge in simulation using a collection of real world data sets and compare with an oracle that has perfect knowledge of future energy demand harvesting and a system that only leverages a battery to lower costs without any renewables We show that GreenCharge s savings for a typical home today are near 20 which are greater than the savings from using only net metering 1983 2012 IEEE

Engineering collective adaptive systems CAS is a challenging task Concurrent systems esp when being large scale are known to be hard to design as the overall system behavior non linearly results from local behavior and interactions They are also hard to engineer and debug as time dependent errors are often hard to reproduce Simulation tools and environments are often used to assist in this task From our experience in developing and using simulators for decentralized systems in traffic logistics and smart power grid management we learned that a simulation environment should comply to the following quality criteria First from a software engineering point of view a simulation environment itself must be designed up to the highest software quality standards modularity separation of concerns test driven development guaranteed state consistency etc are particularly important quality criteria to ensure correctness extensibility and manageability of the software Second the simulation environment must provide convenient support for using and extending the simulation environment ease the visualization of solutions and since its use in scientific process offer direct support for evaluating CAS through the set up of experiments In this paper we present RinSim an open source simulator that explicitly addresses these quality criteria and targets the large family of transportation and logistics applications RinSim separates the definition of the problem domain from the solution has a modular design is being developed in a test driven way etc RinSim has been used and extended in a variety of cases within our research group and served as the core platform in our educational program on multi Agent software development 2012 IEEE
High availability seamless redundancy HSR is a redundancy protocol for Ethernet networks that provides two frame copies for each frame sent Each copy will pass through separate physical paths pursuing zero fault recovery time This means that even in the case of a node or a link failure there is no stoppage of network operations whatsoever HSR is a potential candidate for the communications of a smart grid but its main drawback is the unnecessary traffic created due to the duplicated copies of each sent frame which are generated and circulated inside the network This downside will degrade network performance and might cause network congestion or even stoppage In this paper we present two approaches to solve the above mentioned problem The first approach is called quick removing QR and is suited to ring or connected ring topologies The idea is to remove the duplicated frame copies from the network when all the nodes have received one copy of the sent frame and begin to receive the second copy Therefore the forwarding of those frame copies until they reach the source node as occurs in standard HSR is not needed in QR Our example shows a traffic reduction of 37 5 compared to the standard HSR protocol The second approach is called the virtual ring VRing which divides any closed loop HSR network into several VRings Each VRing will circulate the traffic of a corresponding group of nodes within it Therefore the traffic in that group will not affect any of the other network links or nodes which results in an enhancement of traffic performance For our sample network the VRing approach shows a network traffic reduction in the range of 67 7 to 48 4 in a healthy network case and 89 7 to 44 8 in a faulty network case compared to standard HSR 2012 KICS

Much of the recent work around smart grid information system architecture has been based on standard enterprise architecture approaches While these have been suitable for small scale efforts they do not hold up as well when we consider full scale implementations of smart grids To deal with Smart Grid at Scale SGAS we need to recognize that even paradigms such as System of Systems SoS do not provide sufficient prescription to support robust and effective solution architecture development We look to other approaches including the Ultra Large scale Systems ULS paradigm distributed architecture and layered services models for the conceptual and practical tools to address information management for SGAS In this paper we discuss how the combination of these concepts can lead to powerful architectures that address complexity management wide ranging performance requirements system and device integration and scale for the future We suggest that the foregoing may be addressed by a combination of powerful tools derived from control system theory distributed intelligence models virtualization and an application of the transformation of silos to layers From control theory we apply and extend the concepts of observability and grid state to provide a means to deal with hidden layer coupling in the grid We also adopt the concepts of control federation and disaggregation to deal with the multi objective issue and the distributed asset impact issues respectively Finally we adopt the layered services model advanced networking to construct a foundation upon which smart grid applications of any kind may be built We may apply various kinds of virtualization service data applications to facilitate implementations that can be centralized distributed or hybrid This approach which has been used successfully in other industries can allow differing degrees of distribution vs centralization for various aspects of the smart grid e g distributed data collection and aggregation but centralized control as well as hybrid combinations of centralized and distributed control We base the layered services approach on two foundational ideas network services and a set of core function groups that derive from the nature of smart grid digital superstructure The concept of layered services extends intrinsic smart grid capabilities to the control center and enterprise data center levels using the layer model to unify elements and approaches that have typically been designed and operated as if they were separate and unrelated We also extend this model to provide services related to application integration as well as distributed processing This yields a four tier model wherein each tier is composed of multiple services layers Finally it is useful to recognize the various places in the power grid where distributed intelligence elements may reside and how it can be possible to leverage infrastructure that must be present for other purposes to support the distributed intelligence implementations that provide scalability in smart grid data managemen
Several studies and reports including a report by the CIGRE working group 1 have shown the value of specific energy storage technology applications and cover the need to accumulate benefits from multiple value streams in order to provide a financially convincing investment case In many cases commercial or regulatory reasons may have led to a disappointingly low adoption of the technology The notion of an energy storage device being different and unique in its capabilities has not been largely recognized within the regulatory framework However recent experience over the years 2008 to date has shown an accelerated interest in electrical energy storage and a rapid deployment of projects in marked contrast to the deployment over the previous decade In many cases this increased deployment has been in advance of a true understanding of the value of these projects indeed an important part of the justification of these projects is to better understand the benefits that such technology can bring Many projects have been prompted by money provided either for technology innovation or for demonstration of either energy storage in particular or smart grid applications in general 2 Nevertheless there are also numerous projects where the technical or commercial reasons for applying energy storage provide sufficient justification 3 and growth is accelerating in much the same way that entrepreneurs have pushed the growth of wind and solar generation Examples are given of projects in the power markets of Canada Germany Greece and the United Kingdom with a brief reference to the USA The connection between the power market and current activity in electricity storage is explored Emphasis on developing renewable and sustainable generation as well as deployment of smart grid technology is expected to strengthen the need for further deployment of electricity storage Nevertheless the present rate of deployment is believed to be very slow in comparison to the expected required level Changes in the power systems planners approach to sustainability lead to substantial changes in generation and system planning and further changes caused by review of market procedures mean that a static approach to energy storage can rarely be adopted Power system infrastructure is developing in a stepwise manner more than in an incremental manner Those considering an investment in storage must take into account new thinking on smart grids demand side control and sustainable generation Most deployment of storage appears to be in those areas which can be considered niches usually island systems or small systems especially where there is a need for ancillary services such as frequency regulation peaking or reserve power or mitigation of the effects of integrating renewable generation

The development of smart grids involves the solution of a number of problems foremost among them the issue of protection systems In current practice distribution networks are usually radially operated and protected by means of overcurrent devices thermal magnetic circuit breakers and fuses These devices however do not adequately protect the smart grids which are being developed from traditional radial distribution systems As a matter of fact smart grids can be considered as active networks since besides deriving their main source from a high voltage system they also involve a number of distributed generators which turns the previous radial system into a true active meshed network Moreover during fault conditions a number of converters connecting generators to the grid usually activate automatic auto protection procedures that drastically reduce the converter current creating problems to the protection devices especially when the grid is in islanded mode For these reasons the architecture of the protection systems to be adopted on smart grids cannot be based on traditional overcurrent relays In the present study the option to protect smart grids with distance relays is investigated and then the effectiveness of this solution is properly validated and demonstrated The proposed protection system can actually isolate the faulted line segment allowing as a consequence to maintain all customers energized also in emergency conditions in case the islanded mode is allowed for the portion of the network becoming separated from the main system In order to determine the fault distance which is a necessary premise for fault elimination an algorithm based on the Fast Fourier Transform was developed The proposed protection architecture was tested through simulations carried out with the LabVIEW code on a test system consisting of a 20 kV feeder with cascading segments at whose terminations a number of distributed generators were properly connected In the performed simulations also the presence of harmonic pollution due to converters was taken into account and represented by a set of parallel sources of current and voltage each source having a fixed harmonic frequency All tests refer to a three phase fault and are performed varying fault position and other fault parameters Obtained results show that in the worst conditions the fault distance was estimated with an error below 3 in less than 40 ms for 50 Hz systems The behaviour of the inverters normally used for distributed renewable generators was taken into account as well To this regard a new special control algorithm aimed at obtaining a correct behaviour of inverters during fault conditions is proposed and illustrated

How and to what extent domestic heating systems can be helpful in regaining power balance in a smart grid is the question to be answered in this paper Our case study is an under floor heating system supplied with a geothermal heat pump which is driven by electrical power from the grid The idea is to deviate power consumption of the heat pump from its optimal value in order to compensate power imbalances in the grid Heating systems could be forced to consume energy i e storing it in heat buffers when there is a power surplus in the grid and be prevented from using power in case of power shortage We have investigated how much power imbalance could be compensated provided that a certain yet user adjustable level of residents thermal comfort is satisfied It is shown that the large heat capacity of the concrete floor alleviates undesired temperature fluctuations Therefore incorporating it as an efficient heat buffer is a viable remedy for smart grid temporary imbalances 2011 IEEE

In the design of a solar photovoltaic system one criterion that continues to receive low priority is the provision of minimum inter row spacing for photovoltaic modules Consumers and installers alike strive to maximize area usage for systems such that they achieve the highest amount of annual energy output This in turn leads to module rows being designed very close to each other with array tilt lowered in an attempt to reduce inter row shading This design practice fails to take into consideration many effects that close row spacing can have on system output When designing a photovoltaic array to optimize its performance as a power generator and its contribution to the electric grid during peak demand periods shading concerns become a key consideration This paper describes a process developed at Rowan University s Center for Sustainable Design to test the impact that inter row shading can have on power output and performance across the day A test rig and protocol were created which tested module s output given various depths of shading from one row of modules upon another The exclusion of bypass diodes in the system was also tested to view the most extreme possible cases of power loss induced by shading The results of this experimentation showed that even very small amounts of shading upon solar photovoltaic modules can lead to significant loss in power generation As more PV systems are installed on the utility system their availability during peak times becomes an ever increasing requirement for Smart Grid success This paper also explores the ramifications that proper inter row spacing design guidelines could have on reinforcing some of the fundamental principles of Smart Grid 2011 IEEE
It is essential to estimate how much power can be delivered from vehicles to grid called achievable power capacity APC for practical vehicle to grid V2G services We propose a method of estimating the APC in a probabilistic manner Its probability distribution is obtained from the normal approximation to the binomial distribution and hence represented with two parameters i e mean and covariance Based on the probability distribution of the APC we calculate the power capacity that V2G regulation providers or V2G aggregators are contracted to provide grid operators with called the contracted power capacity CPC Four possible contract types between a grid operator and a V2G regulation provider are suggested and for each contract type a profit function is developed from the APC and the penalty imposed to the V2G aggregator The CPCs for four contract types are chosen to maximize the corresponding profit functions Finally simulations are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the estimated probability distribution of APC and the effectiveness of the profit functions 2011 IEEE

Smart Grid SG achieves bidirectional energy and information flow between the energy user and the utility grid allowing energy users not only to consume energy but also to generate the energy and share with the utility grid or with other energy consumers This type of energy user who consumes energy and who also can generate the energy is called the prosumer The sustainability of the SG energy sharing process heavily depends on its participating prosumers making prosumer participation and management schemes crucial within the energy sharing approaches However in literature there is very little attention on prosumer management schemes The contribution of this article is twofold First this article introduces a novel concept of participating and managing the prosumers in the SG energy sharing process in the form of autonomous intelligent goal oriented virtual communities Here the community of prosumers can collectively increase the amount of power to be auctioned or bought offering higher bargaining power thereby settling for a higher price per kilowatt in long term According to the literature this research is the first of this type introducing a community approach for prosumer management The initial step to build an effective prosumer community is the identification of those prosumers who would be suitable to make efficient prosumer communities This leads the necessity of identifying parameters that influence the energy sharing behaviours of prosumers The second contribution of this article is that this comprehensively analyzes the different parameters influencing the prosumer s energy sharing behaviours and thus presents multi agent architecture for optimal prosumer community formation 2011 IEEE

The processes of voltage distortion variations which are characterized by such electric power quality indices as harmonic voltages and voltage unbalance are random The paper shows that in power networks with different types of loads these random processes are characterized by correlation functions of different types with different numerical values of their parameters To obtain the necessary level of measurement accuracy the sampling rate within the period of the power network voltage and the amount of the sample during measurement in each concrete case must be different The research revealed that neglecting the random process features in the measurement of the levels of the above mentioned electric power quality indices may sometimes reach tens of percent In addition errors of voltage harmonics measurement in high voltage power networks appear due to the nonlinearity of the frequency response of the voltage transformers These errors can be over ten percent also The possible large values of the measurement errors caused by the two factors mentioned above show the expediency of smart meters which can automatically correct the measurement results 2011 IEEE
Electric energy storage devices are prime candidates for demand load management in the smart power grid In this work we address the optimal energy storage control problem from the side of the utility operator The operator controller receives power demand requests with different power requirements and durations that are activated immediately The controller has access to one energy storage device of finite capacity The objective is to devise an energy storage control policy that minimizes long term average grid operational cost The cost is a convex function of instantaneous power demand that is satisfied from the grid and it reflects the fact that each additional unit of power needed to serve demands is more expensive as the demand load increases For the online dynamic control problem we derive a threshold based control policy that attempts to maintain balanced power consumption from the grid at all times in the presence of continual generation and completion of demands The policy adaptively performs charging or discharging of the storage device The former increases power consumption from the grid and the latter satisfies part of the grid demand from the stored energy We prove that the policy is asymptotically optimal as the storage capacity becomes large and we numerically show that it performs very well even for finite capacity The off line problem over a finite time horizon that assumes a priori known power consumption to be satisfied at all times is formulated and solved with Dynamic Programming Finally we show that the model approach and structure of the optimal policy can be extended to also account for a renewable source that feeds the storage device 2011 IEEE

For the open electricity market the price of distributed generation DG will directly affect power producers and power supply enterprises operating costs Generation cost of DG is higher than conventional power in the absence of policy support and financial subsidies there is not enough power to buy electric from DG However because of its characteristics DG could reduce transmission losses to a certain extent thereby reducing the cost of power grid So generation cost difference between DG and conventional power generation does not accurately reflect the amount of subsidies the pricing and subsidy policies is essential In this paper only considering transmission losses on this premise DG pricing critical value is proposed and calculated aiming at the transmission cost does not increase after fixing DG basing on node transmission cost analysis based on power dependency trace If DG price is equal to the critical value which indicate that benefits by reducing the transmission loss is enough to compensate for the losses caused by higher costs If the price is higher than the critical value price power system should be subsidized and accurately calculate the amount of subsidies Finally IEEE9 node system example shows the feasibility of the method 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd

With dwindling nonrenewable energy reserves and the adverse effects of climate change the development of the smart electricity grid is seen as key to solving global energy security issues and to reducing carbon emissions In this respect there is a growing need to integrate renewable or green energy sources in the grid However the intermittency of these energy sources requires that demand must also be made more responsive to changes in supply and a number of smart grid technologies are being developed such as highcapacity batteries and smart meters for the home to enable consumers to be more responsive to conditions on the grid in real time Traditional solutions based on these technologies however tend to ignore the fact that individual consumers will behave in such a way that best satisfies their own preferences to use or store energy as opposed to that of the supplier or the grid operator Hence in practice it is unclear how these solutions will cope with large numbers of consumers using their devices in this way Against this background in this article we develop novel control mechanisms based on the use of autonomous agents to better incorporate consumer preferences in managing demand These agents residing on consumers smart meters can both communicate with the grid and optimize their owner s energy consumption to satisfy their preferences More specifically we provide a novel control mechanism that models and controls a system comprising of a green energy supplier operating within the grid and a number of individual homes each possibly owning a storage device This control mechanism is based on the concept of homeostasis whereby control signals are sent to individual components of a system based on their continuous feedback in order to change their state so that the system may reach a stable equilibrium Thus we define a new carbon based pricing mechanism for this green energy supplier that takes advantage of carbon intensity signals available on the Internet in order to provide real time pricing The pricing scheme is designed in such a way that it can be readily implemented using existing communication technologies and is easily understandable by consumers Building upon this we develop new control signals that the supplier can use to incentivize agents to shift demand using their storage device to times when green energy is available Moreover we show how these signals can be adapted according to changes in supply and to various degrees of penetration of storage in the system We empirically evaluate our system and show that when all homes are equipped with storage devices the supplier can significantly reduce its reliance on other carbon emitting power sources to cater for its own shortfalls By so doing the supplier reduces the carbon emission of the system by up to 25 while the consumer reduces its costs by up to 14 5 Finally we demonstrate that our homeostatic control mechanism is not sensitive to small prediction errors and the supplier is incentivized to accurately predict its green production to minimize costs 2011 ACM

Based on real time measurements Static State Estimation serves as the foundation for monitoring and controlling the power grid The popular weighted least squares with largest normalized residual removed gives satisfactory performance when dealing with single or multiple uncorrelated bad data However when the bad data are correlated or bounded this estimator has poor performance in detecting bad data which leads to erroneous deleting of normal measurements Similar to the Least Trimmed Squares LTS method of robust statistics this paper considers a state estimator built on random sampling However different from previous robust estimators which stop after estimation we regard the LTS estimator as a pre processor to detect bad data A subsequent post processor is employed to eliminate bad data and re estimate the state The new method has been tested on the IEEE standard power networks with random bad data insertions showing improved performance over other proposed estimators 2011 IEEE

The intelligent robust and fast multi class classification of power system disturbances is very important to improve control algorithms for ensuring power system security and reliability an essential function for smart grid infrastructure Moreover in a future power system mostly consisting of distributed generators and renewable energy resources on which the disturbance has more impact the analysis of disturbances by classifying and categorizing real time frequency data is rather critical Fortunately wide area frequency data from a nation wide frequency monitoring network FNET provides a means by which disturbances can be detected However so far none of strategies reported to date has good performance at classifying the disturbances although many of them are used currently in on line analysis The complex and irregular pattern characteristics of each kind of disturbance are the main reason Artificial intelligence methods could be one of the solutions but the large number of input values and an insufficient number of training examples has slowed the reduction of artificial intelligence methods to practice Therefore a mathematical model of common disturbances is proposed to generate a training database for artificial intelligence method and feature extraction by computing the wavelet coefficients parameterizing the results and computer generating the data This paper uses a multi class support vector machine model to be trained on the extracted features to discern the otherwise hard to classify disturbances pattern and upon testing yields good performance 2011 IEEE

Our analysis shows that there is likely to be minor short term risk or reward for electric utilities with respect to electric vehicle adoption but also that significant long term value or risk exists depending on how judiciously utilities manage pricing charging and infrastructure The margin of difference between profit and loss lies with the extent to which customer adoption is clustered whether customers demand faster charging times and how utilities are able to insure optimal charging times are met relative to existing system utility peak loads Customer car purchases are likely to cluster geographically within neighborhoods Customers appear to want fast charging and convenience albeit within some price tolerance And once established a robust PEV market may be difficult to keep up with in terms of infrastructure additions if ignored for too long We share several methodological innovations and results to address these questions including Bass model market forecasting consumer choice simulations mapping spatial adoption and forecasting and profitability assessment over various time and location based
Within the scope of distribution automation there is a wide range of applications that should work co ordinately As the devices supporting such applications are in general spread over a large part of the distribution network one of the key issues to be considered is the communication understood as technology equipment protocols standardization Since equipment and functions are located at different hierarchical levels they should be able to share information among them no matter their relative position within the hierarchy It is also important in order to minimize restrictions to have the possibility of using various technologies even to support the same application One of the most important targets of distribution automation is to detect any fault in the network and to report on it as soon as the failure occurs and at the same time to provide accurate information about the location of the fault Any improvement in the time required to know where the fault occurred will directly minimize the time to isolate the faulty feeder section and restore the network and service to those customers not fed through it Fault location in a distribution network is much more difficult than in a transmission network usually the protection functions and the fault location associated to them are at the substation where the distribution feeder has its origin Due to the complex topology of downstream network the calculated value is far from being as accurate as needed for a fast and reliable service restoration so any method that helps to locate the faults as soon as possible is welcomed Fault indicators based on various indication methods have been a solution applied for long time helping the Distribution System Operator to improve its response after the inception of a fault This paper describes an application for the location of faults in underground urban distribution networks It is build in on a detection communication device that connected to the feeder at distribution centres measures the current and after the fault clearance by the feeder protection at the substation triggers the communication system and sends a message indicating if it detected or not the fault This information is addressed to a processing unit may be the feeder protection or the substation central unit that determine the real location of the failure The communication is supported by a narrow band PLC built in modem that couples the signal to the ground shield of the power cable to reach the substation directly o through other communication technologies as optical fibre GPRS Broad band PLC Once at the substation and after processing all messages received from the detector involved in the fault the fault location is calculated and sent to the control centre or used to initiate an automatism that sends commands to the switches along the feeder to restore the path to the electrical power keeping the line ready to be powered by the recloser at the feeder protection
Numerous analyses including the Prism analysis at the Electric Power Research Institute EPRI show that energy conservation and distributed resource integration are critical elements of an overall strategy to reduce carbon emissions The smart grid is the enabling infrastructure that makes much higher levels of distributed resource integration possible The value is maximized by leveraging Distributed Resources at both the local and overall system level as a virtual power plant to better match energy supply with demand along with related value added benefits Due to the complexity number and scale of the systems and devices involved in creating a demand side virtual power plant interoperability between the various systems is the key to success An interoperable smart grid fosters increased competition among suppliers innovation choice reduced costs and reduced capital risk caused by technology or vendor obsolescence and enables automation resulting in increased value and improved reliability Unfortunately interoperability cannot realistically be achieved by a single entity and requires collaboration from numerous organizations including utilities regulatory bodies standards bodies vendors and more An approach of structured regional utility demonstrations designed to promote and evaluate integration of distributed resources at all levels of power system operations will further smart grid interoperability Utilizing a standardized approach like the IntelliGrid methodology to develop use cases and standard functional requirements can further communication information and control infrastructures required to support integration of emerging technologies as well as identify critical gaps in existing standards providing focus for future research and developmen
The development of distributed energy resources DER is progressing rapidly In modern grids small and medium scale DER together with expanded large scale renewables will supply a significant part of the energy demand Nevertheless the integration of these sources into the local grids represents a big challenge due to bottlenecks such as transport capacity voltage fluctuations fault levels and reactive power When designing a distribution network with mixed load and generation struggling to get a smooth voltage profile and limited short circuit currents is common These issues can be solved more efficiently by using the latest generation HTS High Temperature Superconducting cables These smart cables have an improved non linear voltage current characteristic that enables a smooth voltage profile during normal operation while limiting the current during short circuits and improving the grid stability In this way DER as well as offshore wind farms can efficiently and flexibly be integrated into modern and existing grids The Dutch DSO Alliander together with the nkt cables Southwire joint venture Ultera is studying all these capabilities of HTS technology to solve these issues and support the penetration of DER and large scale renewables An important step will be the 6 km cable Alliander is willing to install in the city of Amsterdam where the potential of smart FLC HTS cables will be demonstrated
The so called Smart Grid or Active Distribution Networks has become a very popular topic in the industry The push originates from the increasing amount of distributed generation DG such as wind farms solar CHP Combined Heat and Power micro turbines etc connected to the distribution networks as well as the tighter requirements on reliability and quality coming from regulations and customers Environmental concerns and energy crisis have also encouraged the efficient use and integration of renewable energies While the focus has always been on the various advanced functions for distribution operation there has been a lack of emphasis on the required ICT Information and Communication Technology to facilitate the former This paper therefore explores the role and importance of communication for smart distribution grid application

The smart grid is a hot topic at utility executive meetings and broader transmission and distribution T D utility forums across the country The concept still elicits mixed reaction but there is increasing agreement on a common defi nition of smart grid as well as an emerging confi dence that the smart grid embodies a set of technology investments that can transform the way service is delivered to customers In addition to cost and service quality improvements the smart grid is increasingly being linked to environmental goals including attaining renewable energy targets and reducing carbon emissions A wide variety of players venture capital companies software and application providers niche engineering firms have entered the smart grid value chain with material investments Utilities are getting bolder in their program designs and in integrating smart grid investments with their aspirations for energy effi ciency and renewables State regulators have been approving pilot programs and building precedents with favorable investment decisions With the development taking real shape there are still areas to be cautious about however Systematic wide scale deployment of demand response has yet to be demonstrated Systems integration is a considerable challenge Worries regarding technology obsolescence continue with new twists as new communications capabilities emerge 2006 IEEE
In the event of a natural disaster mobile networks are expected to provide an added value to search and rescue operations However these networks and their services are not optimized with the requirements for this support in mind A critical aspect is the need for several hours of backup power availability something not usually required during AC grid outages resulting from other technical reasons The availability of the maximum possible number of parallel emergency and voice calls during a disaster is ensured when the Operation Maintenance Center reconfigures the network in accordance with a pre defined emergency plan via a smart SW package This also guarantees minimized power consumption by the basestations The nature of the actual threat determines how the network has to be configured Features such as prioritization of services and shut down of hardware resources are part of this SW package and run automatically according to the pre defined boundary conditions The adaptation of HW resources to the traffic situation can reduce the required battery backup capacity up to 30 in comparison to normal operation and for a given time period which has to be bridged In combination with new battery technologies like Li Polymer which promise high energy densities smaller and lighter battery backup devices can be realized in the future Higher integration of digital components and advancements in power amplifier technology will yield a further reduction in basestation power consumption by up to 40 in the next two to three years more or less independently of the mobile communication standard Therefore for low capacity basestations in rural areas a battery capacity below 5kWh 105Ah 48V DC will be sufficient for eight hours of backup operation For these applications it will be feasible from a volume and cost point of view to omit combustion generation sets as emergency power sources 2008 IEEE
